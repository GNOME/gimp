# Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation

# and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP
# is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap
# file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons,

# you may want to set this to a higher value.  The integer size can contain a
# suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being
