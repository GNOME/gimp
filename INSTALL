Installation instructions for GIMP 2.7
--------------------------------------

There are some basic steps to building and installing GIMP.

GIMP 2.7 replaces earlier GIMP 2.x versions. It is advised that you
uninstall them before installing GIMP 2.7. If you want to keep your
older GIMP 2.x installation in parallel to GIMP 2.7, you have to
choose a separate prefix which is not in your default library search
path.

GIMP 2.7 is fully backward compatible to all earlier GIMP 2.x version.
Plug-ins and scripts written for GIMP 2.6 or earlier GIMP 2.x versions
will continue to work and don't need to be changed nor recompiled to
be used with GIMP 2.7.

The most important part is to make sure the requirements for a build
are fulfilled.  We depend on a number of tools and libraries which are
listed below. For libraries this means you need to also have the
header files installed.


  ******************************************************************
  * Unless you are experienced with building software from source, *
  * you should not attempt to build all these libraries yourself!  *
  * We suggest that you check if your distributor has development  *
  * packages of them and use these instead.                        *
  ******************************************************************


  1. You need to have installed a recent version of pkg-config available
     from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/.

  2. You need intltool (at least 0.40.1, but preferably a newer version).
     Intltool can be downloaded from
     http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/intltool/

  3. You need to have GEGL version 0.1.0 or newer and babl version
     0.1.0 or newer. You can get them from http://gegl.org/ or clone
     them from the GNOME git repository:

       git://git.gnome.org/babl
       git://git.gnome.org/gegl

  4. You need to have installed GTK+ version 2.16.1 or newer.
     GIMP also need a recent versions of GLib (>= 2.20.0) and
     Pango (>= 1.20.1). Sources for these can be grabbed from
     ftp://ftp.gtk.org/.

  5. We use cairo, which is hosted at http://www.cairographics.org/.

  6. We require PangoCairo, a Pango backend using Cairo. Make sure you
     have Cairo, FreeType2 and fontconfig installed before you compile
     Pango. GIMP depends on freetype2 being newer than version 2.1.7
     and fontconfig 2.2.0 or newer. Older versions are known to have
     bugs that seriously affect the stability of GIMP.

  7. We use dbus-glib if available. Grab it from
     http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/

  8. Access of remote files is implemented in the URI plug-in. There
     are several possible implementations for this. The implementation
     used is determined when you configure GIMP. By default the
     GIO/GVfs backend is used. If you don't have GVfs support on your
     target platform, you should pass the '--without-gvfs' option to
     configure. The configure script will then try to detect another
     method for accessing remote files.

  9. You may want to install other third party libraries or programs
     that are needed for some of the available plugins. We recommend
     to check that the following libraries are installed: lcms,
     libpng, libjpeg, libpoppler, libtiff, webkit, libmng, librsvg
     and libwmf.

 10. The Python extension requires Python development headers to be
     present. You will also need PyGTK and the respective development
     headers.

 11. Configure GIMP by running the `configure' script. You may want
     to pass some options to it, see below.

 12. Build GIMP by running `make'. The use of GNU make is recommended.
     If you need to tweak the build to make it work with other flavours
     of make, we'd appreciate if you'd send us a patch with the changes.

 13. Install GIMP by running `make install'. In order to avoid clashes
     with other versions of GIMP, we install a binary called gimp-2.7.
     By default there's also a link created so that you can type 'gimp'
     to start gimp-2.7.

Please make sure you don't have any old GTK+-2.x, jpeg, etc. libraries
lying around on your system, otherwise configure may fail to find the
new ones.


Generic instructions for configuring and compiling auto-configured
packages are included below. Here is an illustration of commands that
might be used to build and install GIMP. The actual configuration,
compilation and installation output is not shown.

  % tar xvfz gimp-2.7.x.tar.gz   # unpack the sources
  % cd gimp-2.7.x                # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                  # run the `configure' script
  % make                         # build GIMP
  % make install                 # install GIMP


The `configure' script examines your system, and adapts GIMP to run on
it. The script has many options, some of which are described in the
generic instructions included at the end of this file. All of the
options can be listed using the command `./configure --help'. There
are several special options the GIMP `configure' script recognizes.
These are:

  --enable-shared and --disable-shared.  This option affects whether
     shared libraries will be built or not. Shared libraries provide
     for much smaller executables. The default is to enable shared
     libraries. Disabling shared libraries is almost never a good idea.

  --enable-debug and --disable-debug.  This option causes the build
     process to compile with debugging enabled. If debugging is
     disabled, GIMP will instead be compiled with optimizations turned
     on. The default is for debugging to be disabled. NOTE: This
     option is intended primarily as a convenience for developers.

  --enable-profile and --disable-profile. This options causes the build
     process to compile with execution profiling enabled. The default is
     for profiling to be disabled. NOTE: This option is intended primarily
     as a convenience for developers.

  --enable-ansi and --disable-ansi.  This option causes stricter
     ANSI C checking to be performed when compiling with GCC. The
     default is for strict checking to be disabled. NOTE: This option
     is intended primarily as a convenience for developers.

  --enable-gimpdir=DIR.  This option changes the default directory
     GIMP uses to search for its configuration files from ~/.gimp-2.7
     (the directory .gimp-2.7 in the users home directory) to DIR.

  --enable-binreloc.  When compiled for Linux with this option enabled,
     GIMP will be binary relocatable.  Plug-ins and data files will
     be searched relative to the gimp binary instead of in the paths
     defined at compile time.

  --with-shm=[none|sysv|posix|auto].  This option allows you to specify
     how image data is transported between the core and plug-ins. Usually
     the best way to do this is detected automatically.

  --without-libtiff, --without-libjpeg, --without-libpng.  configure
     will bail out if libtiff, libjpeg or libpng can not be found. You
     better fix the underlying problem and install these libraries with
     their header files. If you absolutely want to compile GIMP without
     support for TIFF, JPEG or PNG you need to explicitely disable
     them using the options given above.

  --without-exif.  If libexif is available, the JPEG plug-in will use
     it to keep EXIF data in your JPEG files intact.  If this is
     causing any trouble at compile-time, you can build --without-exif.
     Get libexif from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif.

  --without-aa.  The AA plug-in needs libaa and configure checks for
     its presense. Use --without-aa if you run into problems.

  --without-mng.  The MNG plug-in needs libmng and configure checks
     for its presense. If for some reason you don't want to build the
     MNG plug-in even though the library is installed, use
     --without-mng to disable it explicitly.

  --without-wmf.  The WMF plug-in needs libwmf2 and configure checks for
     its presense. Use --without-aa if you run into problems.

  --without-webkit.  If for some reason you don't want to build the
     Help Browser plug-in, you can use --without-webkit to disable
     it explicitly.

  --without-svg.  If for some reason you want to build GIMP without
     SVG support, you can build --without-svg.

  --without-lcms.  If for some reason you want to build GIMP without
     using lcms for color support, you can build with --without-lcms.

  --without-poppler.  If for some reason you don't want to build the PDF
     Import plug-in that uses libpoppler, you can use --without-poppler.

  --without-print.  If for some reason you don't want to build the Print
     plug-in based on the GtkPrint API, you can build with --without-print.

  --without-gvfs.  If you don't want to use GIO/GVfs to access remote
     files, you can pass --without-gvfs to the configure script.

  --without-libcurl.  If you don't want to use libcurl to access remote
     files, you can pass --without-libcurl to the configure script.

  --without-alsa.  If you don't want to compile ALSA support into the
     MIDI input controller module, you can use the --without-alsa option.

  --without-dbus.  If you want to build without D-Bus support, you can
     pass --without-dbus to the configure script.

  --without-linux-input.  If you don't want to compile the Linux Input
     controller module, you can use the --without-linux-input option.

  --without-hal.  If you want to build the Linux Input controller module
     without HAL support, you can use the --without-hal option.

  --with-gif-compression=[lzw|rle|none].  Allows to tune the compression
     algorithm used by the GIF plug-in. If you are afraid of Unisys' LZW
     patent (which should have expired in most countries by now), you
     can go for simple run-length encoding or even configure the plug-in
     to create uncompressed GIFs.

  --enable-gtk-doc.  This option controls whether the libgimp API
     references will be created using gtk-doc. The HTML pages are
     included in a standard tarball, so you will only need this if you
     are building from SVN.

  --with-html-dir=PATH.  This option allows to specify where the
     libgimp API reference should be installed. You might want to modify
     the path so it points to the place where glib and gtk+ installled
     their API references so that the libgimp reference can link to
     them.

  --disable-mp. This option allows you to disable support for multiple
     processors. It is enabled by default.

  --with-sendmail=[PATH]. This option is used to tell GIMP where to find
     the sendmail command. Normally this options don't have to be used
     because configure tries to find it in the usual places.

  --with-desktop-dir=[PATH]. This option specifies where to install
     desktop files. These files are used by desktop environments that
     comply to the specs published at freedesktop.org. The default
     value ${prefix}/share should be fine if your desktop environment
     is installed in the same prefix as gimp. No files are installed
     if you call configure with --without-desktop-dir.

  --disable-default-binary. Use this option if you don't want to make
     gimp-2.7 the default GIMP installation. Otherwise a link called
     gimp pointing to the gimp-2.7 executable will be installed.

  --disable-gimp-console.  Use this option if you don't want the
     gimp-console binary to be built in addition to the standard binary.
     gimp-console is useful for command-line batch mode or as a server.

  --enable-gimp-remote.  Use this option if you want the gimp-remote
     binary to be built. This only works with X11 and it is obsolete if#
     your platform has DBus support.

  --disable-python.  If for some reason you don't want to build the
     Python based PyGIMP plug-in, you can use --disable-python.

  --without-script-fu.  If for some reason you don't want to build the
     Script-Fu plug-in, you can use --without-script-fu.

  --without-xmc.  The X11 Mouse Cursor(XMC) plug-in needs libXcursor
     and configure checks for its presense. If for some reason you
     don't want to build the XMC plug-in even though the library is
     installed, use --without-xmc to disable it explicitly.


The `make' command builds several things:
 - A bunch of public libraries in the directories starting with 'libgimp'.
 - The plug-in programs in the 'plug-ins' directory.
 - Some modules in the 'modules' subdirectory.
 - The main GIMP program 'gimp-2.7' in `app'.

The `make install' commands installs the GIMP header files associated
with the libgimp libraries, the plug-ins, some data files and the GIMP
executable. After running `make install' and assuming the build process
was successful you should be able to run `gimp'.


When ./configure fails
======================

'configure' uses pkg-config, a tool that replaces the old foo-config
scripts. The most recent version is available from
	http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

'configure' tries to compile and run a short GTK+ program. There are
several reasons why this might fail:

* pkg-config could not find the file 'gtk+-2.0.pc' that gets installed
  with GTK. (This file is used to get information about where GTK+ is
  installed.)

  Fix: Either make sure that this file is in the path where pkg-config
  looks for it (try 'pkg-config --debug' or add the location of
  gtk+-2.0.pc to the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH before running
  configure.

* Libraries you installed are not found when you attempt to start GIMP.
  The details of how to fix this problem will depend on the system:

  On Linux and other systems using ELF libraries, add the directory to
  holding the library to /etc/ld.so.conf or to the environment variable
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and run 'ldconfig'.

  On other systems, it may be necessary to encode this path
  into the executable, by setting the LDFLAGS environment variable
  before running configure. For example:

    LDFLAGS="-R/home/joe/lib" ./configure
  or
    LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/home/joe/lib" ./configure

* An old version of the GTK+ libraries was found instead of
  your newly installed version. This commonly happens if a
  binary package of GTK+ was previously installed on your system,
  and you later compiled GTK+ from source.

  Fix: Remove the old libraries and include files.  If you are afraid
  that removing the old libraries may break other packages supplied by
  your distributor, you can try installing GLib, GTK+ and other
  libraries in a different prefix after setting the environment
  variable PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR to point to lib/pkgconfig/ in that new
  prefix so that it does not try to read the *.pc files from the
  default directory (/usr/lib/pkgconfig).  However, removing the old
  packages is often the easier solution.

A detailed log of the ./configure output is written to the file
config.log. This may help diagnose problems.


When ./configure fails on plug-ins
==================================

There are some GIMP plug-ins that need additional third-party libraries
installed on your system. For example to compile the plug-ins that load
and save JPEG, PNG or TIFF files you need the related libraries and header
files installed, otherwise you'll get a message that plugin xyz will not
be built.

If you are sure that those libraries are correctly installed, but configure
fails to detect them, the following might help:

Set your LDFLAGS environment variable to look for the library in a certain
place, e.g. if you are working in a bash shell you would say:
      export LDFLAGS="-L<path_to_library> -L<path_to_another_one>"
before you run configure.

Set your CPPFLAGS environment variable to look for the header file in a
certain place, e.g. if you are working in a bash shell you would say:
      export CPPFLAGS="-I<path_to_header_file> -I<path_to_another_one>"
before you run configure.


      Generic Instructions for Building Auto-Configured Packages
      ==========================================================


To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.  In the directory that this
file is in, type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.
Running `configure' takes a minute or two.

To compile the package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, you must use GNU make.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and
run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR', where DIR is the
directory that contains the source code.  Using this option is
actually unnecessary if the source code is in the parent directory of
the one in which you are compiling; `configure' automatically checks
for the source code in `..' if it does not find it in the current
directory.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man, etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than /usr/local by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for machine-specific
files and machine-independent files.  If you give `configure' the
option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH as the prefix
for installing programs and libraries.  Normally, all files are
installed using the same prefix.

`configure' ignores any other arguments that you give it.

If your system requires unusual options for compilation or linking
that `configure' doesn't know about, you can give `configure' initial
values for some variables by setting them in the environment.  In
Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the command line like
this:
        CC='gcc -traditional' DEFS=-D_POSIX_SOURCE ./configure

The `make' variables that you might want to override with environment
variables when running `configure' are:

(For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:)
CC              C compiler program.
                Default is `cc', or `gcc' if `gcc' is in your PATH.
INSTALL         Program to use to install files.
                Default is `install' if you have it, `cp' otherwise.
INCLUDEDIR      Directory for `configure' to search for include files.
                Default is /usr/include.

(For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:)
DEFS            Configuration options, in the form '-Dfoo -Dbar ...'
LIBS            Libraries to link with, in the form '-lfoo -lbar ...'

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to teach `configure' how to do them and mail the diffs to the
address given in the README so we can include them in the next
release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.

3.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation.

4.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
Makefile(s), the header file containing system-dependent definitions
(if the package uses one), and `config.status' (all the files that
`configure' created), type `make distclean'.

The file `configure.ac' is used as a template to create `configure' by
a program called `autoconf'.  You will only need it if you want to
regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
