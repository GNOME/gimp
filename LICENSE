* Themes are licensed the same as GIMP application core under the GNU GENERAL
  PUBLIC LICENSE -- see the 'COPYING' file in GIMP repository for details:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/blob/master/COPYING

* New icon themes are licensed under Creative Commons by-sa 3.0 or 4.0. See
  the file `icons/Default/COPYING`.
  The Legacy icon theme is more of a patchwork of licenses. See
  `icons/Legacy/COPYING`.

* Any data used in artworks, such as brushes, patterns and the like should be
  under a CC0 license (Creative Commons Zero) or equivalent, i.e. "No rights
  Reserved", because GIMP contributors clearly don't intend to claim any right
  on anyone's work just because they used GIMP and its default data.  We cannot
  clearly give proper licensing on all existing data, prior to the addition of
  this note in the LICENSE file (for historical reasons, simply because their
  contributors are since long gone), though we can say that an uncountable
  number of users have used these for dozens of years and never had legal
  problems as far as we know (it is anyway unclear whether anyone could really
  claim any right for very basic brush or pattern usage). Since 2015, we even
  have a clear FAQ entry to explicitly say the GIMP project has no intention
  whatsoever to put restrictions on people's work:
  https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#can-i-use-gimp-commercially

  Therefore any new data file under the following folders will be expected to be
  CC0:

  - brushes/
  - cursors/
  - patterns/

  All contributors are expected to read the LICENSE file and therefore are
  implicitly agreeing to license their data under CC0 by contributing it as core
  GIMP data.

* Data under images/ may have various licenses which should be detailed in
  `images/README.md`, though we only accept libre licenses, such as:

  - Free Art License: https://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/
  - Creative Commons By-SA: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
  - Creative Commons By: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
  - CC0: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

  Other licenses may be suggested for contributed artworks, and the submissions
  will be considered on a case-by-case basis, though there is no need to submit
  files without clear "Libre Art" licenses (commercial usage, sharing and
  modifications allowed in particular).

* Any code-like contents in this repository, such as build tools, scripts and
  otherwise is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3 or later.
