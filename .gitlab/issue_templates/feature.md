### Description of the feature

<!-- Please describe your feature with details. Also:

- If the feature is UI-related, please DO NOT REPORT HERE. First,
  you should discuss with the community and developers in the forums or
  talk with the developers on IRC: https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html. Then,
  if it really seems to align with GIMP, report it on gimp-ux:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/GIMP/Design/gimp-ux/-/issues;

- If the feature is about some image file format on GIMP, first check if it
  is not already listed on https://developer.gimp.org/core/coding/standards/images,
  then you can make the request, ideally linking relevant resources (e.g. specs);

- If you have a patch, see: https://developer.gimp.org/core/submit-patch/ -->

### Use cases

<!-- Explain the use cases or problems to solve.
If you are unsure, you should first discuss with the community in the forums
