All the developer documentation is exclusively hosted on
[GIMP Developer website](https://developer.gimp.org/).

The `devel-docs` dir only contains some branch-specific information that
can not be hosted on the developer website, which is mainly the
**os-support.txt** file and the **modules explanation** below.
