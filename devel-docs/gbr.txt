The GIMP Paintbrush File Format Version 1 (.gbr)
------------------------------------------------

Based on examples and code, it seems that v1 is like v2, but it is
lacking bytes 20 - 27 (no magic or spacing info), and thus having
as last header field:

Bytes 20 - (header_size - 1):
    Type: char *
    Value: undefined encoding string - name of brush

GBR v1 is deprecated and should never be used to save new brushes.



The GIMP Paintbrush File Format Version 2 (.gbr)
------------------------------------------------

Bytes 0  - 3:  header_size: 
	Type: 32 bit unsigned int
	Value: size of brush header (28) + length of brush name

Bytes 4  - 7: version
	Type: 32 bit unsigned int 
	Value: The file format version.

Bytes 8  - 11: width
	Type: 32 bit unsigned int 
	Value: Brush width

Bytes 12 - 15: height

Bytes 20 - 23: magic_number

The GIMP Paintbrush File Format Version 3 (.gbr)
------------------------------------------------

This changed GIMP brush format was introduced by the FilmGimp or
CinePaint developers without notifying the GIMP developers. We've
added support for reading these brushes. The format is very similar
to version 2 but uses the bytes field as a data format identifier. 
It seems the only format identifier in use is 18 which corresponds
to 16bit floats. If you encounter brushes with a different data
format, please let the GIMP developers know.
