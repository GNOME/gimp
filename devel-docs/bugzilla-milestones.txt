bugzilla-milestones.txt
-----------------------

This document describes how the GIMP project uses milestones in the
Bugzilla bugtracker found at:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=GIMP.


Stable milestone
----------------

The bugs on the stable milestone, i.e. on the 2.6 milestone if GIMP
2.6 is the stable release, are bugs for which fixes will be accepted
onto the stable branch.

Reports for bugs that are fixed in the stable branch should have the
stable milestone set. Usually such a fix is done in the development
branch and then cherry-picked to the stable branch.


Next stable milestone
---------------------

The bugs/enhancement requests on the next stable milestone, i.e. on
the 2.8 milestone if GIMP 2.6 is the stable release, are bugs or
enhancement requests scheduled and planned for inclusion in the next
stable version. This list is rather dynamic and will be altered during
the execution of a development cycle.

If you fix a bug or implement a feature request for the next release,
then please make sure that the milestone is set accordingly. This
allows us to make a list of changes by looking at the resolved bugs on
the milestone.


Future milestone
----------------

The bugs/enhancement requests on the Future milestone are things that
the GIMP project eventually want to include in a future version, but
in what version is not yet decided.
