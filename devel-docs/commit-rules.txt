Commit Rules
============

This file describes rules and things to think about when creating GIMP
commits.

 * Commit message format template:

     modulename: Summary on one line

     Detailed description that may span several paragraphs and
     lines. Like this example description that is more than one
     line. Focus on explaning _why_ the commit is needed.

   or

     Bug XXXXXX - Bug title

     Detailed description that may span several paragraphs and
     lines. Like this example description that is more than one
     line. Focus on explaning _why_ the commit is needed.

   Look at existing commit messages for examples.

 * Keep NEWS up to date

   Whenever you make a change that is worthy of being mentioned in the
   NEWS file, update the NEWS file too. The purpose of this rule is to
   make it as easy as possble to make a GIMP release.
