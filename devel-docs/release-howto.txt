                        How to do a GIMP release
                      ----------------------------
                  a check-list for doing a GIMP release


 ( ) Check that you have working ssh access to ftp.gimp.org and that you
     are a member of the ftp group.

 ( ) Check that ftp.gimp.org has enough space to upload the release and to
     place it into the FTP area. If not, make place or ask Yosh to do that.

 ( ) Check that you have admin access to the GIMP product on
     bugzilla.gimp.org and to the news section on www.gimp.org, or that
     someone can do the changes for you.

 ( ) Make sure the checkout is up to date, clean from uncommitted changes.

 ( ) Check that the version number is correct in configure.ac

 ( ) Run 'make maintainer-clean -k'

 ( ) Run ./autogen.sh --enable-gtk-doc

 ( ) Do a complete build of the source tree.

 ( ) Check if NEWS, README or INSTALL need to be updated.

 ( ) Does the splash screen need to be changed?

 ( ) Run 'make distcheck'.

 ( ) If there are problems with 'make distcheck', fix them and try again.

 ( ) Commit changes that you had to do to get 'make distcheck' running.

 ( ) Add the release entry to the ChangeLog.

 ( ) Run 'make dist' to create the final tarball.

 ( ) Use md5sum to create a checksum of the tarball (tar.bz2).

 ( ) Upload the tarball (tar.bz2) and the .md5 file to your home directory
     on ftp.gimp.org.  Keep a copy of the .md5 file around.

 ( ) Commit the changes to ChangeLog and generated files that were changed
     by running 'make dist'.

 ( ) Tag the release.
      - For a release from trunk:
        svn cp svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/gimp/trunk \
               svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/gimp/tags/GIMP_2_x_y
      - For a release from a branch
        svn cp svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/gimp/branches/gimp_2_x
               svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/gimp/tags/GIMP_2_x_y

 ( ) Move the tarball and the .md5 file to its final destination in the
     FTP area (/home/ftp/pub/gimp/v2.x).

 ( ) Update the 0.0_LATEST-IS- file in the directory on the FTP server.

 ( ) Change permissions of the new files to make them writable by the 'ftp'
     group. This will allow other members of this group to correct mistakes
     and to update the 0.0_LATEST-IS- file next time.

 ( ) Add the new version to the GIMP product on bugzilla.gimp.org.

 ( ) Check out or update the 'gimp-web' module and change
     downloads/index.htrw.  Commit this change, the web server should
     then update itself soon (usually less than an hour).

 ( ) Bump the version number in configure.ac and commit this change.

 ( ) Grab a properly chilled beverage and enjoy yourself.

 ( ) Give the mirrors a reasonably long time to update, then announce the
     release on gimp.org and on the GIMP mailing lists (don't forget
     gimp-announce).
