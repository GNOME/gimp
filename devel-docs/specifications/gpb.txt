Gimp Pixmap Brush File Format

**********************************************
* THIS FORMAT IS OBSOLETE AND SHOULD GO AWAY *
**********************************************

The current format for gpb files, the pixmap
brush format is very simple. What it essentially
boils down to is a greyscale gbr (gimp brush) and
a rgb pat (gimp pattern) concatenated into the same file.
