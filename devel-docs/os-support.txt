## GIMP's Operating System Support

GIMP is available on a wide range of operating systems.
As a general rule, we should stop supporting a platform as soon as the
publisher stops supporting it, or if it is nearly not used anymore.

There is no accurate rule though, and it also mostly depends on what the
developers maintaining GIMP for this platform will decide.


### GNU/Linux, *BSD…

Debian 12 "bookworm" stable is our baseline target.
I.e. that we can bump a minimum dependency version only if it is in Debian
bookworm. See: https://developer.gimp.org/core/setup/build/linux/#supported-distributions

(NOTE TO MAINTAINERS:
If you update this file, so update DEB_VERSION
on .gitlab-ci.yml of this repo and
min-support on content/gimp_versions.json of gimp-web repo)


### macOS

Compatibility with MacOS 11 and over.

(NOTE TO MAINTAINERS:
If you update this file, so update LSMinimumSystemVersion
on package/info.plist.tmpl of gimp-macos-build repo and
min-support on content/gimp_versions.json of gimp-web repo)

Hardware:
* x86_64 (Intel)
* ARM 64-bit (Apple Silicon)


### Windows

Windows 10.0.18362.0 (aka 1903) and over.

(NOTE TO MAINTAINERS:
If you update this file, so update MinVersion
on build/windows/installer/*gimp3264.iss and
on build/windows/store/AppxManifest.xml of this repo and
min-support on content/gimp_versions.json of gimp-web repo)

Hardware:
* x86 32 and 64-bit
