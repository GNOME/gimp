## GIMP's Operating System Support

GIMP is available on a wide range of operating systems.
As a general rule, we should stop supporting a platform as soon as the
publisher stops supporting it, or if it is nearly not used anymore.

There is no accurate rule though, and it also mostly depends on what the
developers maintaining GIMP for this platform will decide.

### GNU/Linux, *BSD…

Until GIMP 3.0 release, Debian 12 "bookworm" stable will be our baseline target.
I.e. that we can bump a minimum dependency version only if it is in Debian
bookworm.

After GIMP 3.0 release, we might get back to depend on Debian Testing.
