## GIMP's Operating System Support

GIMP is available on a wide range of operating systems.
As a general rule, we should stop supporting a platform as soon as the
publisher stops supporting it, or if it is nearly not used anymore.

There is no accurate rule though, and it also mostly depends on what the
developers maintaining GIMP for this platform will decide.

### GNU/Linux, *BSDâ€¦

Minimum dependency versions can be bumped if available in Debian Testing.

### macOS

Compatibility with 10.12 and over.
64-bit only.

### Windows

Windows 7 and over.
32 and 64-bit.
