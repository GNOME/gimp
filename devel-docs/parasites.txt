PARASITE REGISTRY - 2007-10-18
=================

This document is designed for the convenience of GIMP developers.
It does not need to concern users.

>>>> If your plugin or script writes parasites, please
>>>> amend this file in SVN or submit patches to

------------------------------------------------------------------
*** NAMESPACE

Plug-in-specific data should be prefixed by the plug-in function name and
a slash, i.e. private data of plug_in_displace should be named like:

plug_in_displace/data1
plug_in_displace/data2
etc.

Global data follows no strict rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------
*** KNOWN PREFIXES:

"tiff"    : The standard GIMP TIFF plugin
"jpeg"    : The standard GIMP JPEG plugin
"png"     : The standard GIMP PNG plugin
"dcm"     : The standard GIMP DICOM plugin
"gimp"    : For common and standard parasites

------------------------------------------------------------------
*** KNOWN GLOBAL PARASITES:

"jpeg-save-defaults" (GLOBAL, PERSISTENT)
        Default save parameters used by the JPEG plug-in.

"png-save-defaults" (GLOBAL, PERSISTENT)
        Default save parameters used by the PNG plug-in.

"<plug-in>/_fu_data" (GLOBAL, IMAGE, DRAWABLE, PERSISTENT)
        The Gimp::Fu module (Perl) might store the arguments of the
        last plug-in invocation. It is usually attached to images,
        but might also be found globally. The data format is either
        pure character data (Data::Dumper) or a serialized data
        stream created by Storable::nfreeze.

"exif-orientation-rotate" (GLOBAL, PERSISTENT)
        Whether a load plug-in should automatically rotate the image
        according to the orientation specified in the EXIF data. This
        has values "yes" or "no". If the parasite is not set, the
        plug-in should ask the user what to do. This parasite may be
        removed in a future version (assuming always yes).

------------------------------------------------------------------
*** KNOWN IMAGE PARASITES:

"gimp-comment" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
        Standard GIF-style image comments.  This parasite should be
        human-readable text in UTF-8 encoding.  A trailing \0 might
        be included and is not part of the comment.  Note that image
        comments may also be present in the "gimp-metadata" parasite.

"gimp-brush-name" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
        A string in UTF-8 encoding specifying the name of a GIMP brush.
        Currently, the gbr plug-in uses this parasite when loading and
        saving .gbr files. A trailing \0 might be included and is not
        part of the name.

"gimp-brush-pipe-parameters" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	This is all very preliminary:

	A string, containing parameters describing how an brush pipe
	should be used. The contents is a space-separated list of
	keywords and values. The keyword and value are separated by a
	colon.

	This parasite is currently attached to an image by the psp
	plug-in when it loads a .tub file (Paint Shop Pro picture
	tube). It is used (first attached with values asked from the
	user, if nonexistent) by the gpb plug-in when it saves a .gih
	file. The .gih file contains the same text in it.

	The keywords are:
	ncells: the number of brushes in the brush pipe
	step: the default spacing for the pipe
	dim: the dimension of the pipe. The number of cells
		in the pipe should be equal to the product
		of the ranks of each dimension.
	cols: number of columns in each layer of the image,
		to be used when editing the pipe as a GIMP image
	rows: ditto for rows. Note that the number of columns and rows
		not necessarily are identical to the ranks of the
		dimensions of a pipe, but in the case of two-
		and three-dimensional pipes, it probably is.
	rank0, rank1, ...: (one for each dimension): the index range
		for that dimension
	placement: "default", "constant" or "random". "constant" means
		use the spacing in the first brush in the pipe.
		"random" means perturb that with some suitable
		random number function. (Hmm, would it be overdoing it
		if the pipe also could specify what random function
		and its parameters...?)
	sel0, sel1, ...: "default", "random", "incremental", "angular",
		"pressure", "velocity", and whatever else suitable we might
		think of ;-) Determines how one index from each dimension is
		selected (until we have pinpointed the brush to use).

"gimp-image-grid" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
        The GimpGrid object serialized to a string. Saved as parasite
        to keep the XCF files backwards compatible. Although gimp-1.2
        does not know how to handle the image grid, it keeps the grid
        information intact.

"gimp-pattern-name" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
        A string in UTF-8 encoding specifying the name of a GIMP pattern.
        Currently, the pat plug-in uses this parasite when loading and
        saving .pat files. A trailing \0 might be included and is not
        part of the name.

"tiff-save-options" (IMAGE)
        The TiffSaveVals structure from the TIFF plugin.

"jpeg-save-options" (IMAGE)
        The JpegSaveVals structure from the JPEG plugin.

"jpeg-exif-data" (IMAGE) (deprecated)
        The ExifData structure serialized into a uchar* blob from
        libexif. This is deprecated in favor of "exif-data".

"jpeg-original-settings" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	The settings found in the original JPEG image: quality (IJG),
	color space, component subsampling and quantization tables.
	These can be reused when saving the image in order to minimize
	quantization losses and keep the same size/quality ratio.

"gamma" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	The original gamma this image was created/saved. For JPEG; this is
        always one, for PNG it's usually taken from the image data. GIMP
        might use and modify this. The format is an ascii string with the
        gamma exponent as a flotingpoint value.

        Example: for sRGB images this might contain "0.45454545"

"chromaticity" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	This parasite contains 8 floatingpoint values (ascii, seperated by
        whitespace) specifying the x and y coordinates of the whitepoint, the
        red, green and blue primaries, in this order.

        Example: for sRGB images this might contain
        "0.3127 0.329 0.64 0.33 0.3 0.6 0.15 0.06"
         wx     wy    rx   ry   gx  gy  bx   by
 
"rendering-intent" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	This specifies the rendering intent of the image. It's a value
        between 0 and 3, again in ascii:

        0 - perceptual			(e.g. for photographs)
        1 - relative colorimetric	(e.g. for logos)
        2 - saturation-preserving	(e.g. for business charts)
        3 - absolute colorimetric

"hot-spot" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	Use this parasite to store an image's "hot spot". Currently
	used by the XBM plugin to store mouse cursor hot spots.

	Example: a hot spot at coordinates (5,5) is stored as "5 5"

"exif-data" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
        The ExifData structure serialized into a character array by
        libexif (using exif_data_save_data). If a "gimp-metadata"
        parasite is present, it should take precedence over this one.

"gimp-metadata" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT)
	The metadata associated with the image, serialized as one XMP
	packet.  This metadata includes the contents of any XMP, EXIF
	and IPTC blocks from the original image, as well as
	user-specified values such as image comment, copyright,
	license, etc.

"icc-profile" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT | UNDOABLE)
	This contains an ICC profile describing the color space the
	image was produced in. TIFF images stored in PhotoShop do 
	oftentimes contain embedded profiles. An experimental color
	manager exists to use this parasite, and it will be used
	for interchange between TIFF and PNG (identical profiles)

"icc-profile-name" (IMAGE, PERSISTENT | UNDOABLE)
        The profile name is a convenient name for referring to the
        profile. It is for example used in the PNG file format.  The
        name must be stored in UTF-8 encoding. If a file format uses
        a different character encoding, it must be converted to UTF-8
        for use as a parasite.

"decompose-data" (IMAGE, NONPERSISTENT) 
        Starting with GIMP 2.4, this is added to images produced by
        the decompose plug-in, and contains information necessary to
        recompose the original source RGB layer from the resulting
        grayscale layers.  It is ascii; a typical example would be
        "source=2 type=RGBA 4 5 6 7".  This means that layer 2 was
        decomposed in RGBA mode, giving rise to layers 4, 5, 6, and 7.

"print-settings" (IMAGE, NONPERSISTENT) 
        This parasite is stored by the Print plug-in and holds settings
        done in the Print dialog. It also has a version field so that
        changes to the parasite can be done. GIMP 2.4 used version 0.3.
        The format is GKeyFile. A lot of the contents are identical to
        what is stored in ~/.gimp-2.x/print-settings but the parasite
        has some additional image-related fields.

"print-page-setup" (IMAGE, NONPERSISTENT) 
        This parasite is stored by the Print plug-in and holds settings
        done in the Page Setup dialog. The format is GKeyFile as created
        from GtkPageSetup. The content is identical to what is stored in
	~/.gimp-2.x/print-page-setup.

"dcm/XXXX-XXXX-AA" (IMAGE, PERSISTANT)
        These parasites are stored by the Dicom plug-in and hold the DICOM
        element information for that image. The format is raw binary data
        as read from the original image.
        where: XXXX is a 4-digit ascii encoded hexadecimal number
               AA is a two character ascii value representing the Dicom
                 element's Value Represenation (VR)

------------------------------------------------------------------
*** KNOWN LAYER/DRAWABLE PARASITES:

"gimp-text-layer" (LAYER, PERSISTENT)
        The associated GimpText object serialized to a string. For
        convenience the string is terminated by a trailing '\0'.
        The idea of using a parasite for text layers is to keep the XCF
        files backward compatible. Although gimp-1.2 doesn't know how
        to handle the text layer, it keeps the parasite intact.

"gfig" (LAYER, PERSISTENT)
        As of GIMP 2.2, the gfig plug-in creates its own layers, and
        stores a representation of the figure as a layer parasite.
        The parasite contains a GFig save file, in an ascii format.
        If gfig is started while the active layer contains a "gfig"
        parasite, the contents of the parasite are loaded at startup.


------------------------------------------------------------------
*** PARASITE FORMAT:

The parasite data format is not rigidly specified. For non-persistant
parasites you are entirely free, as the parasite data does not survive the
current gimp session. If you need persistant data, you basically have to
choose between the following alternatives (also, having some standard for
non-persistant data might be fine as well):

- Cook your own binary data format
  
  You can invent your own data format. This means that you will either
  loose totally (consider endian-ness or version-ness issues) or you will
  get yourself into deep trouble to get it "right" in all cases.

- Use character (string) data

  Obvious to perl people but less so to C programmers: just sprintf your
  data into a string (e.g. "SIZE 100x200 XRES 300 YRES 300") and store
  that in the parasite, and later sscanf it again. This often solves most
  of the problems you might encounter, makes for easier debugging and
  more robustness (consider the case when you add more entries to your
  persistant data: older plug-ins might be able to read the relevant
  parts and your application can detect missing fields easily). The
  drawback is that your data is likely to be larger than a compact binary
  representation would be. Not much a problem for most applications,
  though.

  You could also use one parasite per field you store, i.e. foo-size,
  foo-offset-x, foo-offset-y etc...

- Use the libgimpconfig serialize functions

  This is a special case of the previous one, using the convenience
  functions provided by libgimpconfig.  If you are not concerned about
  the size of the string representation of your data, you can use
  gimp_config_serialize_to_string() and other functions to easily
  convert your data to/from a character string.
