sub display_id_is_valid {
    $blurb = 'Returns TRUE if the display ID is valid.';

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure checks if the given display ID is valid and refers to an
existing display.


*Note*: in most use cases, you should not use this function. If you got a
[class@Gimp.Display] from the API, you should trust it is valid. This
function is mostly for internal usage.

    $help = <<'HELP';
Creates a new display for the specified image. If the image already has a
display, another is added. Multiple displays are handled transparently by
GIMP. The newly created display is returned and can be subsequently destroyed
with a call to gimp_display_delete(). This procedure only makes sense for use
with the GIMP UI, and will result in an execution error if called when
GIMP has no UI.

This procedure removes the specified display. If this is the last remaining 
display for the underlying image, then the image is deleted also. Note that
the display is closed no matter if the image is dirty or not. Better save
the image before calling this procedure.

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure returns a handle to the native window for a given image
display.

It can be different types of data depending on the platform you are running on.
For example in the X backend of GDK, a native window handle is an Xlib
XID whereas on Wayland, it is a string handle. A value of NULL is
returned for an invalid display or if this function is unimplemented for
the windowing system that is being used.

This procedure connects all displays of the old_image to the
