sub text_font {
    $blurb = <<'BLURB';
Add text at the specified location as a floating selection or a new layer.
BLURB

    $help = <<'HELP';
The x and y parameters together control the placement of the new text by
specifying the upper left corner of the text bounding box. If the specified
drawable parameter is valid, the text will be created as a floating selection
attached to the drawable. If the drawable parameter is not valid (%NULL), the
text will appear as a new layer. Finally, a border can be specified around the
final rendered text. The border is measured in pixels.

The size is always in pixels. If you need to display a font in points, divide
the size in points by 72.0 and multiply it by the image's vertical resolution.

    $help = <<'HELP';
This tool returns the width and height of a bounding box for the specified text
rendered with the specified font information. Ascent and descent of the glyph
extents are returned as well.

The ascent is the distance from the baseline to the highest point of the
character. This is positive if the glyph ascends above the baseline.
The descent is the distance from the baseline to the lowest point of the
character. This is positive if the glyph descends below the baseline.

The size is always in pixels. If you need to set a font in points, divide the
size in points by 72.0 and multiply it by the vertical resolution of the image
you are taking into account.
