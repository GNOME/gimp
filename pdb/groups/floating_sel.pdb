This procedure anchors the floating selection to its associated drawable. This 
is similar to merging with a merge type of ClipToBottomLayer.  The floating
selection layer is no longer valid after this operation.

This procedure transforms the specified floating selection into a layer with
the same offsets and extents. The composited image will look precisely the
same, but the floating selection layer will no longer be clipped to the extents
of the drawable it was attached to. The floating selection will become the
active layer. This procedure will not work if the floating selection has a
different base type from the underlying image. This might be the case if the
floating selection is above an auxiliary channel or a layer mask.
