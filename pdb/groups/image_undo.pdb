sub image_undo_group_start {

    $help = <<'HELP';
This function is used to start a group undo--necessary for logically combining
two or more undo operations into a single operation. This call must be used in
conjunction with a ligma_image_undo_group_end() call.

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure checks if the image's undo stack is currently enabled or
disabled.  This is useful when several plug-ins or scripts call each other
and want to check if their caller has already used ligma_image_undo_disable()
or ligma_image_undo_freeze().

This procedure disables the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent operations
to ignore their undo steps. This is generally called in conjunction with
ligma_image_undo_enable() to temporarily disable an image undo stack. This is
advantageous because saving undo steps can be time and memory intensive.

    &adam_pdb_misc('1999');

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure freezes the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent
operations to ignore their undo steps.  This is generally called in
conjunction with ligma_image_undo_thaw() to temporarily disable an
image undo stack.  This is advantageous because saving undo steps can
be time and memory intensive.  ligma_image_undo_freeze() /
ligma_image_undo_thaw() and ligma_image_undo_disable() /
ligma_image_undo_enable() differ in that the former does not free up
all undo steps when undo is thawed, so is more suited to interactive
in-situ previews.  It is important in this case that the image is back
to the same state it was frozen in before thawing, else 'undo'
behaviour is undefined.

sub image_undo_thaw {

    &adam_pdb_misc('1999');

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure thaws the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent
operations to store their undo steps. This is generally called in
conjunction with ligma_image_undo_freeze() to temporarily freeze an
image undo stack.  ligma_image_undo_thaw() does NOT free the undo stack
as ligma_image_undo_enable() does, so is suited for situations where
one wishes to leave the undo stack in the same state in which one
found it despite non-destructively playing with the image in the
meantime.  An example would be in-situ plug-in previews.  Balancing
freezes and thaws and ensuring image consistency is the responsibility
of the caller.
