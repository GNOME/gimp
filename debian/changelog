gimp1.1 (1.1.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #72193, #74115
  * Fixed improper use of "it's" in app/user_install.c. Forwarded
    patch  upstream. Closes: #71521
  * Fixed upstream: installation crash (Closes: #71519)
  * Looked at a lot of the nice changes in the helix gimp1.1 packages
    and applied 'em.
  * IMPORTANT MOVE: I realized that the libgimp1.1.27-style packages
    had to die a flaming horrible death. Moved to libgimp1.1 and
    libgimp1.1-dev package naming style. This has the consequence
    that I've had to make the shlibs file make things compiled against
    libgimp1.1 depend on libgimp1.1 (>= 1.1.27.0), libgimp1.1 (<< 1.1.28).
  * Because of the above, to clean out everyone's systems, I've made
    libgimp1.1 Conflict: with all the old libgimp1.1.xs, and libgimp1.1-dev
    Conflict: with all old libgimp1.1.x-devs. Closes: #62532
  * Move the tiff plug-in to the main gimp package; only the gif
    one uses patented crud any more.
  * Bugs fixed long long ago: lprng moved lpc to /usr/sbin. Closes: #48655
  * script-fu breakage due to not having fonts installed documented
    in README.Debian and dependancies. Closes: #48840, #49003
  * gimp1.1-perl split out long ago. Closes: #53873
  * some Perl bug, fixed upstream long ago: Closes: #54502, #54666, #54668, #54687 
  * Can't reproduce big swapfile loading two pngs in a row. Probably
    fixed upstream. Closes: #56240
  * Can't reproduce crash on 'gimp --no-data -n -b "(gimp-quit 1)"' call,
    there is no -n flag! Closes: #60941
  * No problems loading EPS files whatsoever. Closes: #61536 
  * Old libgimp1.1.x lying around problem cured with new naming
    scheme. Closes: #62532
  * Selection -> By Color does not segfault any more. Closes: #62659
  * Transparency dithering when converting to Indexed has been
    implemented. Closes: #63719
  * xcftopnm is included in gimp1.1-perl now. Closes: #63748, #63502
  * Printing to postscript does not make an 'all black image'.
    Closes: #65378
  * Freshened up README.Debian and lightened dire font warnings.
    Closes: #65664
  * The BMP mentioned in bug #67415 does not crash GIMP. Closes: #67415
  * Faulty order in package build (built gimp1.1 before gimp1.1-perl)
    led some Perl plugins to be included in the gimp1.1 package.
    Fixed. Closes: #67523, #70811
  * User installation crash fixed upstream. Closes: #71519
  * Patched it's typo in installation. Sent patch upstream. Closes: #71521
  * Patched to move all config files to /etc/gimp-1.1/ instead of
    /usr/share/gimp/1.1/ . Sent patch upstream. Closes: #72161
  * GIMP seems to have no problems parsing lpc's output when using
    lprng for me. Closes: #72448
  * gimp-python is maintained separately. Closes: #58548 
  * Moved gimp binary to /usr/bin. This is to follow policy, and
    also fixes a problem with the GIMP Perl module. Closes: #66469
  * Um. Control+mouse button 1 doesn't select; it deselects. This
    is documented. Closes: #65326
  * Yes, gimp1.1 is in the archives for woody. Closes: #61641

gimp1.1 (1.1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Sorry for slacking off there.) Closes: #64294
  * Add Build-Depends line. Closes: #62896
  * (Hopefully) add Help support in by installing the new libgtkxmhtml-dev
    package. Yes, this indirectly requires GNOME libraries -- but only
    to build. libgtkxmhtml1 does not require GNOME libraries at run-time,
    so I'm satisfied. Closes: #52634

gimp1.1 (1.1.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Please don't let there be any i18n breakage
    this time...
  * To separate the perl plugins, instead of a static list we now
    run 'file' on usr/lib/gimp/1.1/plug-ins/* and any that say
    'perl script' we include in gimp1.1-perl.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Apr 2000 22:56:19 -0700

gimp1.1 (1.1.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Use CVS po files for i18n to avoid crashes,
    and patch da_DK po file by hand because it's still broken.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2000 09:02:08 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.17-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Move gimp-tool into libgimp1.1.17-dev, and make libgimp1.1.17-dev 
    Depend: on libgtk1.2-dev and libglib1.2-dev. Closes: #59057
  * Fixes locale brokenness for it_IT, ru_RU, de_DE. (Updated the po
    files from CVS gimp current as of 27 Feb 2000.) Closes: #58796, #56503,
    #57498, #57403,

gimp1.1 (1.1.15-3) frozen unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Fix GIMP crashes by moving Perl-Server plugin out of main
    gimp1.1 package into gimp1.1-perl. Closes: #56237
    (Yes, this must make it into frozen, otherwise gimp1.1 doesn't
     work.)
  * As a consequence of the above, gimp1.1-perl Replaces: gimp1.1 
    (<< 1.1.15-3).
  * Make sure libgimp1.1.15 doesn't include any Perl directories.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Jan 2000 16:37:41 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.15-2) frozen unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Argh. I had messed up the build process and no files actually
    got into gimp1.1-perl. This rebuild must make it into frozen,
  * Make gimp1.1-perl Depend: on gimp1.1 (>= ${Source-Version}) so
    people don't try to install it with a mismatching gimp package.
  * Add Suggests: from gimp1.1 to gimp1.1-perl.
  * To make slink -> potato upgrade easier (read: possible), sprinkle 
    Replaces: liberally around.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Jan 2000 14:14:56 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Bump Standards to 3.1.1.1.
  * Move Perl plugins and support into gimp1.1-perl. Closes: #54562

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Jan 2000 11:26:57 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add dependancies on libgtk-perl and pdl. Closes: #53971, #53826
  * Build with perl Image::Magick support. Add dependancy on perlmagick.
  * If anyone thinks any of the above new dependancies (libgtk-perl, pdl,
    perlmagick) should be made into Suggests, let me know. I couldn't
    decide, so went with a Depends to be on the safe side. But, this
    requires about 6 more megs of packages to be installed, so some
    people may not be happy.
  * Patch the stupid Makefile.PL in plug-ins/perl/Makefile.PL to not
    force UNINST=1 on the 'make install'. GRRR!

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Jan 2000 18:08:02 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not include 'perllocal.pod' in install.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Dec 1999 12:18:17 -0800

gimp1.1 (1.1.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Now includes gimp-perl and the related Perl plugins in the main 
    gimp package. Closes: #34392
  * Still no gimp help browser, as libgtkxmhtml-dev depends on a whole
    slew of GNOME libraries which I am not willing to foist on
    unsuspecting GIMP users.
  * Fixed in earlier releases: Closes: #42096, #42699

gimp1.1 (1.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Change auto-generation of shlibs file to make things compiled against
    libgimp to depend on (e.g.) >= 1.1.8 instead of >= 1.1.8-1. This
    makes building slink packages with versions like 1.1.8-0slink1
    work.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 21:27:29 -0700

gimp1.1 (1.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Change Recommends: of xfnts-100dpi to a Suggests, as it seems GIMP will
    work without it nowadays.
  * Upstream has restructured /usr/share/gimp and I missed it; that's
    why the help files and tips of the day were missing. 
    (Fixes: #42699, #42096)
  * libgimp1.1.8-dev Depends: on Source-Version of libgimp1.1.8 now.

gimp1.1 (1.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make it easier for myself to make new releases by automatically
    generating the shlibs.local file, and other changes to debian/rules

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Thu, 13 May 1999 14:16:19 -0700

gimp1.1 (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The Perl extension won't work until the Debian libgtk-perl package
    is updated. So I'm releasing this without the Perl extension until
    libgtk-perl is recompiled against GTK+ 1.2 and updated from the
    upstream source.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Apr 1999 14:23:15 -0700

gimp1.1 (1.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

gimp (1.0.2-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile for ncurses 4.2 and related aalib

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Nov 1998 20:29:13 -0800

gimp (1.0.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * The gimp package no longer depends explicitly on xfnt{75,100}. I
    downgraded the relationship to a Recommends: and added big fat
    warnings in the README and in the package description.
    Fixes bugs #14600 and #21055. This has been changed because it's
    possible to run GIMP using a remote font server to serve the 75/100dpi
    fonts. However, it's really no big deal to ask for them to be installed
    locally, so the relationship should be Recommends:.
  * The above Recommends: has been changed to xfonts-{75,100}dpi, although
    it's pretty silly that their names were changed without adding a
    Provides:. *grumble*
  * Bumped the version number in the dependancy of gimp on gimp-data-extras
    to (>= 1:1.0.0).
  * libgimp-dev now conflicts with libglib-dev, so people don't try
    compiling plugins when they only have GTK+ 1.1 installed.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Oct 1998 10:46:23 -0800
