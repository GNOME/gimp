# set to 0. The actual size can contain a suffix of 'm', 'M',

#
# One important item to keep in mind:  Many images that you might
#  get from outside sources will in all likelihood already be
#  gamma-corrected.  In these cases, the image will look washed-out
#  if the gimp has gamma-correction turned on.  If you are going
