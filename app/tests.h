/* Automake doc says:
   "When no test protocol is in use, an exit status of 0 from a test
   script will denote a success, an exit status of 77 a skipped test,
   an exit status of 99 an hard error, and any other exit status will
   denote a failure."

   Unfortunately glib returns a SUCCESS when you skip tests, which is
   not a reliable test feedback. So we hard-code the SKIPPED return
