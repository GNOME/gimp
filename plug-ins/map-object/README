Compiling
=========

To compile you'll need GIMP 1.0 and GTK+ 1.0.4 or later.
You'll also need GCK 1.00 (http://www.ii.uib.no/~tomb/gck.html)

1) Edit the Makefile to reflect your system setup.

2) Type "make" and then "make install"

You should now be ready to run. "make install" puts the executable "MapObject"
in the standard plug-in directory.

Documentation
=============

Ahem.. right.. ;) ..I'll get around to it eventually.

Please send me a mail if you find any bugs.

Have fun,

Tom
