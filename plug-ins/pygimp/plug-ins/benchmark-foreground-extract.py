#   Foreground Extraction Benchmark
#   Copyright 2005  Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>
#
#   This is a from-scratch implementation of the benchmark proposed in
#   "GrabCut": interactive foreground extraction using iterated graph
#   cuts published in the Proceedings of the 2004 SIGGRAPH Conference.
#
#   No guarantee is made that this benchmark produces the same results
#   as the cited benchmark but the goal is that it does. So if you find
#   any bugs or inaccuracies in this code, please let us know.
#
#   The benchmark has been adapted work with the SIOX algorithm
#   (http://www.siox.org). which is (currently) the only
#   implementation of gimp_drawable_foreground_extract(). If other
#   implementations are being added, this benchmark should be changed
#   accordingly.
#
#   You will need a set of test images to run this benchmark, preferably
#   the original set of 50 images. Some of these images are from the
#   Berkeley Segmentation Dataset
#   (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/vision/grouping/segbench/).
#   See also http://www.siox.org/details.html for trimaps.
