"""
Exports the image histogram to a text file,
so that it can be used by other programs
and loaded into spreadsheets.

The resulting file is a CSV file (Comma Separated
Values), which can be imported
directly in most spreadsheet programs.

The first two collums are the bucket boundaries,
followed by the selected columns. The histogram
refers to the selected image area, and
can use either Sample Average data or data
from the current drawable only.;

The output is in "weighted pixels" - meaning
all fully transparent pixels are not counted.

Check the gimp-histogram call
