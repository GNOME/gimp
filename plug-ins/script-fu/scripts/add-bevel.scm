;
; Adds a bevel to an image.  See http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ard/gimp/
;
; If there is a selection, it is bevelled.
; Otherwise if there is an alpha channel, the selection is taken from it
; and bevelled.
; Otherwise the part of the layer inside the image boundaries is bevelled.
;
; The selection is set on exit, so Select->Invert then Edit->Clear will
; leave a cut-out.  Then use Sven's add-shadow for that
; floating-bumpmapped-texture cliche.

;
; 1.01: now works on offset layers.
; 1.02: has crop-pixel-border option to trim one pixel off each edge of the
;       bevelled image.  Bumpmapping leaves edge pixels unchanged, which
;       looks bad.  Oddly, this is not apparent in GIMP - you have to
;       save the image and load it into another viewer.  First noticed in
;       Nutscrape.
;       Changed path (removed "filters/").
; 1.03: adds one-pixel border before bumpmapping, and removes it after.
;       Got rid of the crop-pixel-border option (no longer reqd).
; 1.04: Fixed undo handling, ensure that bumpmap is big enough,
;       (instead of resizing the image). Removed references to outdated
;       bumpmap plugin.     (Simon)
; 1.05  When there is no selection, bevel the whole layer instead of the
;       whole image (which was broken in the first place).
;       Also fixed some bugs with setting the selection when there is no
;       initial selection.     (Barak Itkin)
