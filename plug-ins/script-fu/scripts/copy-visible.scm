; 2004-04-14 This script was almost rewritten from scratch
;     by Raphaël Quinet <raphael@gimp.org>
;     see also http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139989
;
; The code is new but the API is the same as in the previous version:
; "Copy Visible"  version 0.11 01/24/98
;     by Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>
;   _heavily_ based on:
;        cyn-merge.scm   version 0.02   10/10/97
;        Copyright (C) 1997 Sven Neumann (neumanns@uni-duesseldorf.de)
;
; Removed all code and made it a backward-compat wrapper around
;     (gimp-edit-copy-visible)
