Format of pictures is:

An ASCII file containing some or all of the following lines:
	FirstName:
	LastName:
	E-mail:
	Telephone:
	Company:
	Address1:
	Address2:
	CityStateZip:
	Date:
	PicData:         Actual data:  width - height - bits/pixel
	Image:           Should be transformed to: width - height - bits/pixel
	(A REQUIRED Blank line)

	Hexified picture  in scanline order, in the form suitable for
printing in postscript. It is unpadded scanlines, I believe left to right.
If it is bottom to top it is due to funny transforms in going from the real
scanned image, which came from a video camera turned on its side! (to get a
portrait aspect ratio).
All the images are 8 bits per pixel, and have been intensity levelled to
use up the full dynamic range (each pixel multiplied by 256/(max - min) and
shifted so that min becomes zero).
I'm sorry about that, I should have put out untransformed data.
The original frame grabbing was off a Targa M8, and the gamma varied due
to a number of real world factors.  Most pictures had a dynamic range in
the 128 - 196 vicinity.

The line labeled Image: can be used to correct for non-square pixels.
In most cases, there are 108 (non-square) pixels across in the data, but they
would have been 96 pixels across if they were square.  Therefore,
Image: says 96, PicData says 108.
