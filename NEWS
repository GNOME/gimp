                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP.  Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.8.


Changes in GIMP 2.7.0
=====================

UI:

 - Change the Text Tool to perform text editing on-canvas (GSoC 2008)
 - Add support for tagging GIMP resources such as brushes and allow
   filtering based on these tags (GSoC 2008)
 - Separate the activies of saving an image and exporting it, there is
   now an 'File->Export...' for example
 - Add a simple parser to size entry widgets, images can be scaled
   to e.g. "50%" or "2 * 37px + 10in"
 - Arrange layer modes into more logical and useful groups
 - Added support for rotation of brushes
 - Make the Pointer dockable show information about selection position
   and size
 - Add status bar feedback for keyboard changes to brush paramaters
 - Add diagonal guides to the Crop Tool
 - New docks are created at the pointer position
 - Add support for printing crop marks for images
 - Move 'Text along path' from tool options to text context menu
 - Change default shortcuts for "Shrink Wrap" and "Fit in Window" to
   Ctrl+R and Ctrl+Shift+R respectively since the previous shortcuts
   are now used for the save+export feature

 - Prepare better and more intuitive handling of the floating
   selection

   image

   File->Debug->Benchmark Projection
