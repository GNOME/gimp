                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP. Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.10.

Generally, all bug fixes that are applied on the stable GIMP 2.8
branch are also applied here, but they are usually not mentioned
in NEWS.

Overview of Changes from GIMP 2.9.4 to GIMP 2.9.6
=================================================

Core:

  - New clipboard implementation allows copying/pasting layers and 
    layer groups
  - Color tags simplify managing large projects with a lot of layers 
    and layer groups
  - The Mouse Pointer dialog and colors applied to images are 
    color-managed now
  - Gamma and precision selectors for newly created images
  - Never dither when converting to a higher bit depth, or to anything 
    more than 16 bits, don't offer dithering options in these cases
  - Вefault to linear when converting to 16-bit float
  - Pre-initialize some babl-based pixel format conversion routines 
    at the start-up to decrease the initial lazy intialization cost
    for some interactions

GUI:

  - Easily add or remove layer masks by clicking either the layer 
    preview or a new button in the Layers dialog
  - Enhance the Layer Attributes dialog to provide the single UI for 
    setting layer's name, blending mode, opacity, and offset, 
    toggling visibility, link status, various locks, color tags.
  - Add a Save As button to the “Quit GIMP” dialog and raise images
    on click for easy checks.
  - Allow to choose fill color when resizing layers and images
  - Quick Mask and Channel Attributes dialogs use the new spinscale
    widget for the  mask opacity slider
  - Enable grid views of dynamics and tool presets
  - Allow to zoom with middle mouse button + control + drag up/down
  - Standard (Freedesktop) and GTK+ icons can now be set by the icon
    theme for a fully consistent style.
  - Many new icons

Configurability:

  - Remember settings of many dialogs across sessions
  - New Interface / Dialog Defaults page in the Preferences dialog to 
    control defaults values of various dialogs
  - Settings on some individual pages of the Preferences dialog can be
    reset separately now
  - Vertical scrollbar added to keep the height of the Preferences 
    dialog fitting small displays
  - Allow mouse to optionally configure tablet devices

Tools:

  - The Move tool now shows relative coordinates when moving guides 
    and sample points
  - Performance of the Fuzzy Select and the Bucket Fill tool has been
    improved
  - The Warp Transform tool now uses the linear sampler to ensure 
    crisp lines after an erase
  - Select by Color and Color Picker tools work correctly in color 
    spaces other than sRGB now
  - Uncommitted selection by the Intelligent Scissors tool is not 
    discarded on tool change anymore.

Painting:

  - Rulers, scrollbars, and the Navigation dialog follow canvas 
    rotation now
  - Canvas rotation is snappier in certain cases now

File Formats

  - Add native WebP loader/exporter with support for ICC profiles, 
    animation, metadata
  - The TIFF loader will not generate warnings about private tags 
    anymore
  - Handle linear gamma PNG files correctly
  - Load PSD files with layers which contain additional information 
    with a length that is not divisible by 4

Color Palettes

  - Merge Palettes command is available for multiple selected color 
    palettes now

PDB:

  - Rename *-paste-as-new to *-paste-as-new-image

Build:

  - Depends on LCMS2.7+ now, because earlier LCMS2 releases caused 
    problems with certain GIMP blend modes
  - Depends on libpng 1.6.25+ to avoid warnings about known incorrect 
    sRGB profiles, also avoid various vulnerabilities

OS-specific changes:

  - Help browser launches on OS X now

Bugs:

  - Overall 60 bugs have been fixed or partially addressed since 
    GIMP 2.9.4

Translations:
