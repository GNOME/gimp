                   ------------------------------
                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP.  Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.8.


Changes in GIMP 2.7.3
=====================


UI:

 - Use GimpSpinScales instead of scale entries in all dockable widgets
 - Allow the spin scale to control a range larger than its scale's range
 - Implement RTL mode in GimpSpinScale
 - Add lots of tooltips to tool options
 - Allow to drop more things to the empty image window, and simply
   create new images from them
 - Cage tool: allow to add handle to the cage when clicking on an edge
 - Cage tool: allow to remove selected handles from the cage by hitting delete
 - Remember column widths in multi-column dock windows
 - Support starting GIMP in single-window mode
 - When the brush is shared among paint tools, also share all
   brush-modifying paint options
 - Use ALT+number and ALT+Tab shortcuts to navigate between images
   in both single- and multi-window mode
 - Make 'Export to' always activatable and fall back to 'Export...' if
   no export target has been set yet
 - In single-window mode, add new dockable dialogs to the image window
   instead of in a new window
 - When switching on single-window mode, put docks in the image window
   depending on what side of the window they originally had
 - When switching off single-window mode, distribute dock windows
   better
 - Add a canvas item for the transform grid, fixing a major speed
   regression, and add the same guides options as in the rectangle tools
 - Don't unmaximize the single-window mode image window when closing
   images
 - Resurrect the "You can drop dockable dialogs here" help string
   below the toolbox


Core:

 - Add GimpMotionBuffer which abstracts away stroke smoothing behind
   a simple API and takes it out of GimpDisplayShell
 - Add a GimpIdTable utility class
 - Add a GimpDockContainer interface
 - Add a GimpSessionManaged interface
 - Add GimpCanvasRectangleGuides which makes the rectangle tool's
   guides draw properly


Libgimp:

 - Make libgimp depend on GdkPixbuf
 - Add API to create layers from cairo surfaces
 - Make it impossible to include individual files from any GIMP
   library. This was always forbidden and designed so it most
   probably breaks, but now it reliably breaks using #error
 - Deprecate the "set_sensitive" logic and use g_object_bind_property()


Plug-ins:

 - Use poppler's cairo API to load PDFs, the pixbuf API is removed
 - Port screenshot from GdkPixbuf to cairo
 - Fix the annoying parser build warnings in imagemap
 - Add a check-for-deprecated-procedures-in-script-fu make target
 - Update libpng code to not use deprecated API (file-mng and file-png)
 - Add an Item class to pygimp
 - Correct/update some labels and defaults in the JPEG plug-in's save dialog UI
 - Fix "Bug 596410 - gimp-image-get-filename returns NULL for imported files"


Developer documentation:

 - Many updates


Source and build system:

 - Make cairo a global dependency, starting at libgimpcolor
 - Require poppler >= 0.12.4
 - Remove gimp-remote for good, it has been disabled for years


General:

 - Some more undeprecations now that we use GTK+ 2.24
 - Fix lots of warnings that are new in -Wall in GCC 4.6
 - Lots of bug fixes and cleanup
 - Lots of translation updates


Changes in GIMP 2.7.2
=====================


UI:

 - A lot of undeprecations due to GTK+ 2.22 and 2.24
 - Lots and lots of cairo porting, calls to gdk_draw_* are gone
 - Merge the cage transform tool from GSoC
 - Remove the old bitmap cursors completely and always use RGBA cursors
   also for compat cursors for old X servers
 - Add new GimpCanvasItem infrastructure with subclasses for everything
   that needs to be drawn on the canvas and port all tools to canvas items,
   this is a huge change that touches all tools and almost all display
   code, and which finally gets rid of XOR drawing altogether
 - Switch from purely idle-rendering the display to something that ensures
   a minimum framerate, so we don't fail to update under heavy load
 - Make the text tool handle RTL mode better
 - Change GimpColorMapEditor to use the newly added proxy GimpPalette
 - Replace the brush scale control in tool options by a brush size
   one that works in pixels, and does the right thing when the brush
   changes
 - Add new widget GimpSpinScale which is a scale with number entry,
   and use it in all tool options
 - Make the brush, pattern etc. selectors in tool options more
   compact and allow to directly jump to the editor dialogs
 - Make handle sizes in tools consistent
 - Add an on-canvas progress and use it for tool progress instead of
   the statusbar
 - Add a new GimpToolPalette class with lots of code that was
   in GimpToolBox
 - Allow to properly drop into and after a layer group
 - Refactor and clean up the dynamics editor widget, and add colors
   for the curves
 - Add support for F2 to rename items in lists
 - Clean up GimpDeviceStatus internally and visually
 - Allow to set GimpToolPreset's icon using the new GimpIconPicker widget
 - Make the text tool's style overlay show default values from the
   text object if there is no style active at the cursor position/selection
 - Show the the text size's unit in the text style overlay
 - Make tool dialogs transient to the image window again
 - Consistently add a "gimp-" prefix to all window roles
 - Make the preset buttons in tool options work on the global tool
   presets instead of the removed per-tool preset lists
 - Add GimpControllerMouse, which allows to bind extra mouse buttons to
   arbitrary actions


Core:

 - Add uniform API to turn any GimpItem's outline into a selection
 - Add support for color tags in text layers
 - Remove the selection_control() stuff from GimpImage and with it
   maybe last piece of UI code still not properly separated

   utility functions
 - Clean up GimpViewRenderer API

   consistently shutdown all tools in control(HALT), and many other
   tool fixes
 - Remove GimpToolPresets object, this functionality got merged into
   the new GimpToolPreset system
 - Rename GimpFilteredContainer to GimpTaggedContainer and add a new
   GimpFilteredContainer parent class which is a generic filter
 - Remove the concept of an "offset" from TileManager and instead
   pass around the offsets explicitly when needed, like when
   transforming
 - Move GimpBezier desc from vectors/ to core/ and add API to create
   one from sorted BoundSegs
 - Change GimpBrush boundary API to return a GimpBezierDesc
 - Add GimpBrushCache object and use it to cache a brush's transformed
   pixels and its outline, remove the caching code from GimpBrushCore
 - Add GimpBezierDesc based API to GimpScanConvert and use it


GEGL:

 - Add operations and gegl infrastructure for the cage tool
 - Disable View -> Use GEGL as we will not have time to finish the
   GEGL projection code for GIMP 2.8


Libgimp:
