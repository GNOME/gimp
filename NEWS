                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP.  Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.8.


Changes in GIMP 2.7.0
=====================

UI:

 - Change the Text Tool to perform text editing on-canvas (GSoC 2008)
 - Add support for tagging GIMP resources such as brushes and allow
   filtering based on these tags (GSoC 2008)
 - Separate the activies of saving an image and exporting it, there is
   now an 'File->Export...' for example
 - Port file plug-ins to new export API which gets rid of many
   annoying export dialogs
 - Add a simple parser to size entry widgets, images can be scaled
   to e.g. "50%" or "2 * 37px + 10in"
 - Arrange layer modes into more logical and useful groups
 - Added support for rotation of brushes
 - Make the Pointer dockable show information about selection position
   and size
 - Get rid of the Tools dockable and move toolbox configuration to
   Preferences
 - Add status bar feedback for keyboard changes to brush paramaters
 - Add diagonal guides to the Crop Tool
 - New docks are created at the pointer position
 - Add support for printing crop marks for images
 - Move 'Text along path' from tool options to text context menu
 - Change default shortcuts for "Shrink Wrap" and "Fit in Window" to
   Ctrl+R and Ctrl+Shift+R respectively since the previous shortcuts
   are now used for the save+export feature
 - Make Alt+Click on layers in Layers dockable create a selection from
   the layer
 - Allow to specify written language in the Text Tool


Plug-ins:

 - Map the 'Linear Dodge' layer mode in PSD files to the 'Addition'
   layer mode in GIMP
 - Add JPEG2000 load plug-in
 - Add X11 mouse cursor plug-in
 - Add support for loading 16bit (RGB565) raw data
 - Add palette exporter for CSS, PHP, Python, txt and Java, accessed
   through palette context menu
 - Add plug-in API for getting image URI, for manipulating size of
   text layers, for getting and setting text layer hint, and for
   unified export dialog appearance


Data:

 - Add large variants of round brushes and remove duplicate and
   useless brushes
 - Add "FG to BG (Hardedge)" gradient


GEGL:

 - Port the projection code, the code that composes a single image
   from a stack of layers, to GEGL
 - Port layer modes to GEGL
 - Port the floating selection code to GEGL
 - Refactor the layer stack code to prepare for layer groups later
 - Prepare better and more intuitive handling of the floating
   selection
 - Add File->Debug->Show Image Graph that show the GEGL graph of an
   image
 - Allow to benchmark projection performance with
   File->Debug->Benchmark Projection
 - When using GEGL for the projection, use CIELCH instead of HSV/HSL
   for color based layer modes


Core:

 - Make painting strokes Catmull-Rom Spline interpolated
 - Add support for arbitrary affine transforms of brushes
 - Add support for brush dynamics to depend on tilt
 - Add aspect ratio to brush dynamics
 - Add infrastructure to soon support vector layers (GSoC 2006)
 - Rearrange legacy layer mode code to increase maintainability
 - Drop support for the obsolete GnomeVFS file-uri backend
 - Allow to dump keyboard shortucts ith File->Debug->Dump Keyboard
   Shortcuts
 - Prepare data structures for layer groups
 - Remove gimprc setting "menu-mnemonics",
   "GtkSettings:gtk-enable-mnemonics" shall be used instead
 - Remove "transient-docks" gimprc setting, the 'Utility window' hint
   and a sane window manager does a better job
 - Remove "web-browser" gimprc setting and use gtk_show_uri() instead


General:

 - Changed licence to (L)GPLv3+
 - Use the automake 1.11 feature 'silent build rules' by default
 - Lots of bug fixes and cleanup
