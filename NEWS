                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP.  Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.8.


Changes in GIMP 2.7.1
=====================


UI:

 - A lot of undeprecations due to GTK+ 2.22 and 2.24
 - Lots and lots of cairo porting, calls to gdk_draw_* are gone
 - Merge the cage transform tool from GSoC
 - Remove the old bitmap cursors completely and always use RGBA cursors
   also for compat cursors for old X servers
 - Add new GimpCanvasItem infrastructure with subclasses for everything
   that needs to be drawn on the canvas and port all tools to canvas items
 - Switch from purely idle-rendering the display to something that ensures
   a minimum framerate, so we don't fail to update under heavy load
 - Make the text tool handle RTL mode better
 - Change GimpColorMapEditor to use the newly added proxy GimpPalette
 - Replace the brush scale control in tool options by a brush size
   one that works in pixels, and does the right thing when the brush
   changes

Core:

 - Add uniform API to turn any GimpItem's outline into a selection
 - Add operators and gegl infrastructure for the cage tool
 - Add support for color tags in text layers
 - Remove the selection_control() stuff from GimpImage and with it
   maybe last piece of UI code still not properly separated

 - Add accessors to GimpPalette and use them globally
 - Keep a proxy GimpPalette around for the image's colormap

   lots of old API in favor of item API

 - Add more state to the context API, and deprecate functions with
   too many parameters in favor of simpler ones that use context states,
   particularly the entire transform and selection API

 - Various changes that make msaintaining the gtk3-port branch easier,
   such as s/GtkAnchorType/GimpHandleAnchor/ and s/GtkObject/GtkAdjustment/
