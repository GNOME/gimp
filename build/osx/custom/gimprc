# The variable ${gimp_dir} is set to the value of the environment variable

# Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the

# Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation
# scheme. The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk
# and back in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP
# is used with large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap
# file is created on a folder that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons,
# it may be desirable to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a single

# images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise.  If you have a lot of RAM,
# you may want to set this to a higher value.  The integer size can contain a
# suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being
