.SH NAME
gimprc \- gimp configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gimprc
file is a configuration file read by GIMP when it starts up.  There
are two of these: one system-wide one stored in
@gimpsysconfdir@/gimprc and a per-user @manpage_gimpdir@/gimprc
which may override system settings.

Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the end
of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

The
.B gimprc
file associates values with properties.  These properties may be set
by lisp-like assignments of the form:
.IP
\f3(\f2property\-name\ value\f3)\f1
.TP
where:
.TP 10
.I property\-name
is one of the property names described below.
.TP
.I value
is the value the property is to be set to.
.PP

Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.
.PP
.SH PROPERTIES
Valid properties and their default values are:

.TP
(temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the
course of running GIMP.  Most files will disappear when GIMP exits, but some
files are likely to remain, so it is best if this folder not be one that is
shared by other users.  This is a single folder.

.TP
(swap-path "${gimp_dir}")

Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme.
The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back
in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with
large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created
on a folder that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons, it may be desirable
to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a single folder.

.TP
(num-processors 1)

Sets how many threads GIMP should use for operations that support it.  This is
an integer value.

.TP
(tile-cache-size 2g)

When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap
tiles to disk.  This is a lot slower but it makes it possible to work on
images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise.  If you have a lot of RAM, you
may want to set this to a higher value.  The integer size can contain a suffix
of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified
in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the
size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.

.TP
(use-opencl no)

When enabled, uses OpenCL for some operations.  Possible values are yes and
no.

.TP

Specifies the language to use for the user interface.  This is a string value.

.TP
(interpolation-type cubic)

Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations. 
Possible values are none, linear, cubic, nohalo and lohalo.

.TP
(default-threshold 15)

Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a seed-fill
algorithm.  The seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and
progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the
original is greater than a specified threshold. This value represents the
default threshold.  This is an integer value.

.SH PATH EXPANSION
Strings of type PATH are expanded in a manner similar to
.BR bash (1).
Specifically: tilde (~) is expanded to the user's home directory. Note that
the bash feature of being able to refer to other user's home directories
by writing ~userid/ is not valid in this file.

${variable} is expanded to the current value of an environment variable.
There are a few variables that are pre-defined:
.TP
.I gimp_dir
The personal gimp directory which is set to the value of the environment
variable GIMP3_DIRECTORY or to @manpage_gimpdir@.
.TP
.I gimp_data_dir
Base for paths to shareable data, which is set to the value of the
environment variable GIMP3_DATADIR or to the compiled-in default value
@gimpdatadir@.
.TP
.I gimp_plug_in_dir
Base to paths for architecture-specific plug-ins and modules, which is set
to the value of the environment variable GIMP3_PLUGINDIR or to the
compiled-in default value @gimpplugindir@.
.TP
.I gimp_sysconf_dir
Path to configuration files, which is set to the value of the environment
variable GIMP3_SYSCONFDIR or to the compiled-in default value 
@gimpsysconfdir@.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @gimpsysconfdir@/gimprc
