.SH NAME
gimprc \- gimp configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gimprc
file is a configuration file read by GIMP when it starts up.  There
are two of these: one system-wide one stored in
@gimpsysconfdir@/gimprc and a per-user \fB$HOME\fP/@gimpdir@/gimprc
which may override system settings.

Comments are introduced by a hash sign (#), and continue until the end
of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.

The
.B gimprc
file associates values with properties.  These properties may be set
by lisp-like assignments of the form:
.IP
\f3(\f2property\-name\ value\f3)\f1
.TP
where:
.TP 10
.I property\-name
is one of the property names described below.
.TP
.I value
is the value the property is to be set to.
.PP

Either spaces or tabs may be used to separate the name from the value.
.PP
.SH PROPERTIES
Valid properties and their default values are:

.TP
(temp-path "${gimp_dir}/tmp")

Sets the folder for temporary storage. Files will appear here during the
course of running GIMP.  Most files will disappear when GIMP exits, but some
files are likely to remain, so it is best if this folder not be one that is
shared by other users.  This is a single folder.

.TP
(swap-path "${gimp_dir}")

Sets the swap file location. GIMP uses a tile based memory allocation scheme.
The swap file is used to quickly and easily swap tiles out to disk and back
in. Be aware that the swap file can easily get very large if GIMP is used with
large images. Also, things can get horribly slow if the swap file is created
on a folder that is mounted over NFS.  For these reasons, it may be desirable
to put your swap file in "/tmp".  This is a single folder.

.TP
(num-processors 1)

Sets how many processors GIMP should try to use simultaneously.  This is an
integer value.

.TP
(tile-cache-size 1024M)

When the amount of pixel data exceeds this limit, GIMP will start to swap
tiles to disk.  This is a lot slower but it makes it possible to work on
images that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise.  If you have a lot of RAM, you
may want to set this to a higher value.  The integer size can contain a suffix
of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size as being specified
in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the
size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.

.TP
(interpolation-type cubic)

Sets the level of interpolation used for scaling and other transformations. 
Possible values are none, linear, cubic and lanczos.

.TP
(plug-in-path "${gimp_dir}/plug-ins:${gimp_plug_in_dir}/plug-ins")

the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least as many undo-levels as
configured can be undone.  The integer size can contain a suffix of 'B', 'K',

kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix is specified the size defaults
to being specified in kilobytes.

the layers and channels dialog are nice to have but they can slow things down
when working with large images.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP
(layer-preview-size medium)

Sets the preview size used for layers and channel previews in newly created
dialogs.  Possible values are tiny, extra-small, small, medium, large,
extra-large, huge, enormous and gigantic.

none, normal and large.

.TP
(thumbnail-filesize-limit 4M)

The thumbnail in the Open dialog will be automatically updated if the file
being previewed is smaller than the size set here.  The integer size can
contain a suffix of 'B', 'K', 'M' or 'G' which makes GIMP interpret the size
as being specified in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. If no suffix
is specified the size defaults to being specified in kilobytes.

.TP

Install a private colormap; might be useful on 8-bit (256 colors) displays.

into and out of images.  Possible values are yes and no.

.TP
(resize-windows-on-resize no)

When enabled, the image window will automatically resize itself whenever the

(perfect-mouse yes)

When enabled, the X server is queried for the mouse's current position on each
motion event, rather than relying on the position hint.  This means painting
with large brushes should be more accurate, but it may be slower.  Conversely,
on some X servers enabling this option results in faster painting.  Possible
values are yes and no.

the bash feature of being able to refer to other user's home directories
by writing ~userid/ is not valid in this file.

${variable} is expanded to the current value of an environment variable.
There are a few variables that are pre-defined:
.TP
.I gimp_dir
The personal gimp directory which is set to the value of the environment
variable GIMP2_DIRECTORY or to ~/@gimpdir@.
.TP
.I gimp_data_dir
Base for paths to shareable data, which is set to the value of the
environment variable GIMP2_DATADIR or to the compiled-in default value
@gimpdatadir@.
.TP
.I gimp_plug_in_dir
Base to paths for architecture-specific plugins and modules, which is set
to the value of the environment variable GIMP2_PLUGINDIR or to the
compiled-in default value @gimpplugindir@.
