"Scale the specified drawable"
"This tool scales the specified drawable if no selection exists.  If a selection exists, the portion of the drawable which lies under the selection is cut from the drawable and made into a floating selection which is then scaled by the specified amount.  The interpolation parameter can be set to TRUE to indicate that either linear or cubic interpolation should be used to smooth the resulting scaled drawable.  The return value is the ID of the scaled drawable.  If there was no selection, this will be equal to the drawable ID supplied as input.  Otherwise, this will be the newly created and scaled drawable."

Essentially, the color at the specified coordinates (in the drawable) is measured and the selection expands outwards from that point to any adjacent pixels which are not significantly different (as determined by the threshold value).  This process continues until no more expansion is possible.  The antialiasing parameter allows the final selection mask to contain intermediate values based on close misses to the threshold bar at pixels along the seed fill boundary.  Feathering can be enabled optionally and is controlled with the \"feather_radius\" paramter.  If the sample_merged parameter is non-zero, the data of the composite image will be used instead of that for the specified drawable.  This is equivalent to sampling for colors after merging all visible layers.  In the case of a merged sampling, the supplied drawable is ignored.  If the sample is merged, the specified coordinates are relative to the image origin; otherwise, they are relative to the drawable's origin."

s.  This option requires more time and memory to compute than non-antialiased text; the resulting floating selection or layer, however, will require the same amount of memory with or without antialiasing.  If the specified drawable parameter is valid, the
 text will be created as a floating selection attached to the drawable.  If the drawable parameter is not valid (-1), the text will appear as a new layer.  Finally, a border can be specified around the final rendered text.  The border is measured in pixel

The gamma value determines how intensities between the low and high input intensities are interpolated.  A gamma value of 1.0 results in a linear interpolation.  Higher gamma values result in more high-level intensities.  Lower gamma values result in more low-level intensities.  The low/high output levels constrain the final intensity mapping--that is, no final intensity will be lower than the low output level and no final intensity will be higher than the high output level.  This tool is only valid on RGB color and grayscale images.  It will not operate on indexed drawables."

The interpolation parameter can be set to TRUE to indicate that either linear or cubic interpolation should be used to smooth the resulting remapped drawable.  The return value is the ID of the remapped drawable.  If there was no selection, this will be equal to the drawable ID supplied as input.  Otherwise, this will be the newly created and remapped drawable.  The 4 coordinates specify the new locations of each corner of the original bounding box.
