      GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be
      augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about
      anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything
      from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation
      procedures to be easily scripted. GIMP is available for Linux,
      Microsoft Windows and OS X.
