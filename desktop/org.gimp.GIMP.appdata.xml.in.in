      GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a
      freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching,
      image composition and image authoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint
      program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an online
      batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an
      image format converter, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be
      augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about
      anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything
      from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation
      procedures to be easily scripted. GIMP is available for Linux,
      Microsoft Windows and OS X.

        GUI feature freeze.
        This release contains huge core logic updates on several areas so we are really welcoming
        feedbacks and reports to reach stability state sooner.

        For this third development release, more development effort has been shifted towards the API.
        Many functions were renamed for consistent naming scheme, some
        new functions appeared, some had signature changes, fixes were
        made to improve introspection binding of others, and so on.
        More API updates are to be expected on further development releases where stability is not guaranteed.
