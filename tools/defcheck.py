This is a hack to check the consistency of the .def files compared to
the respective libraries.

Invoke in the top level of the gimp source tree after compiling GIMP.
If srcdir != builddir, run it in the build directory and pass the name
of the source directory on the command-line.

Needs the tool "nm" to work
