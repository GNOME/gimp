This procedure checks if the given display ID is valid and refers to an
existing display.

sub display_new {

    $help = <<'HELP';
Creates a new display for the specified image. If the image already has a
display, another is added. Multiple displays are handled transparently by
GIMP. The newly created display is returned and can be subsequently destroyed
with a call to gimp_display_delete(). This procedure only makes sense for use
with the GIMP UI.

This procedure removes the specified display. If this is the last remaining 
display for the underlying image, then the image is deleted also. Note that
the display is closed no matter if the image is dirty or not. Better save
the image before calling this procedure.

This procedure returns a handle to the native window for a given image
display. For example in the X backend of GDK, a native window handle is
an Xlib XID. A value of 0 is returned for an invalid display or if this
function is unimplemented for the windowing system that is being used.

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure connects all displays of the old_image to the
new_image.  If the old_image has no display or new_image already has a
display the reconnect is not performed and the procedure returns
without success.  You should rarely need to use this function.
