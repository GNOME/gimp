sub display_new {
    $blurb = 'Create a new display for the specified image.';

    $help = <<'HELP';
Creates a new display for the specified image. If the image already has a
display, another is added. Multiple displays are handled transparently by the
GIMP. The newly created display is returned and can be subsequently destroyed
with a call to 'gimp-display-delete'. This procedure only makes sense for use
with the GIMP UI.

This procedure removes the specified display. If this is the last remaining 
display for the underlying image, then the image is deleted also.

This procedure takes no arguments and returns nothing except a success status.
Its purpose is to flush all pending updates of image manipulations to the user
interface. It should be called whenever appropriate.
