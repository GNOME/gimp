sub gimprc_query {

Queries the gimprc file parser for information on a specified token.
BLURB

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure is used to locate additional information contained in the gimprc
file considered extraneous to the operation of the GIMP. Plug-ins that need
configuration information can expect it will be stored in the user gimprc
file and can use this procedure to retrieve it. This query procedure will
return the value associated with the specified token. This corresponds _only_
to entries with the format: (<token> <value>). The value must be a string.
Entries not corresponding to this format will cause warnings to be issued on
gimprc parsing a nd will not be queryable.

This procedure is used to add or change additional information in the gimprc
file that is considered extraneous to the operation of the GIMP. Plug-ins that
need configuration information can use this function to store it, and
gimp_gimprc_query to retrieve it.  This will accept _only_ parameters in the
format of (<token> <value>), where <token> and <value> must be strings. Entries
not corresponding to this format will be eaten and no action will be performed.
If the gimprc can not be written for whatever reason, gimp will complain loudly
and the old gimprc will be saved in gimprc.old.
