    $help = <<'HELP';
If there is a selection in the image, then the area specified by the selection
is cut from the specified drawable and placed in an internal GIMP edit buffer.
It can subsequently be retrieved using the 'gimp-edit-paste' command. If there
is no selection, then the specified drawable will be removed and its contents
stored in the internal GIMP edit buffer. The drawable MUST belong to the
specified image, or an error is returned.

If there is a selection in the image, then the area specified by the selection
is copied from the specified drawable and placed in an internal GIMP edit
buffer. It can subsequently be retrieved using the 'gimp-edit-paste' command.

sub edit_paste {
    $blurb = 'Paste buffer to the specified drawable.';

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure pastes a copy of the internal GIMP edit buffer to the specified
drawable. The GIMP edit buffer will be empty unless a call was previously made
to either 'gimp-edit-cut' or 'gimp-edit-copy'. The "paste_into" option
specifies whether to clear the current image selection, or to paste the buffer
"behind" the selection. This allows the selection to act as a mask for the
pasted buffer. Anywhere that the selection mask is non-zero, the pasted buffer
will show through. The pasted buffer will be a new layer in the image which is
designated as the image floating selection. If the image has a floating
selection at the time of pasting, the old floating selection will be anchored
to it's drawable before the new floating selection is added. This procedure
returns the new floating layer. The resulting floating selection will already
be attached to the specified drawable, and a subsequent call to
floating_sel_attach is not needed.

sub edit_clear {

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure clears the specified drawable. If the drawable has an alpha
channel, the cleared pixels will become transparent. If the drawable does not
have an alpha channel, cleared pixels will be set to the background color. This
procedure only affects regions within a selection if there is a selection
active.
