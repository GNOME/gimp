sub image_undo_group_start {

    $help = <<'HELP';
This function is used to start a group undo--necessary for logically combining
two or more undo operations into a single operation. This call must be used in
conjunction with a gimp_image_undo_group_end() call.

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure checks if the image's undo stack is currently enabled or
disabled.  This is useful when several plugins or scripts call each other
and want to check if their caller has already used gimp_image_undo_disable()
or gimp_image_undo_freeze().

This procedure disables the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent operations
to ignore their undo steps. This is generally called in conjunction with
gimp_image_undo_enable() to temporarily disable an image undo stack. This is
advantageous because saving undo steps can be time and memory intensive.

    &adam_pdb_misc('1999');

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure freezes the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent
operations to ignore their undo steps.  This is generally called in
conjunction with gimp_image_undo_thaw() to temporarily disable an
image undo stack.  This is advantageous because saving undo steps can
be time and memory intensive.  gimp_image_undo_freeze() /
gimp_image_undo_thaw() and gimp_image_undo_disable() /
gimp_image_undo_enable() differ in that the former does not free up
all undo steps when undo is thawed, so is more suited to interactive
in-situ previews.  It is important in this case that the image is back
to the same state it was frozen in before thawing, else 'undo'
behaviour is undefined.

sub image_undo_thaw {

    &adam_pdb_misc('1999');

    $help = <<'HELP';
This procedure thaws the image's undo stack, allowing subsequent
operations to store their undo steps. This is generally called in
conjunction with gimp_image_undo_freeze() to temporarily freeze an
image undo stack.  gimp_image_undo_thaw() does NOT free the undo stack
as gimp_image_undo_enable() does, so is suited for situations where
one wishes to leave the undo stack in the same state in which one
found it despite non-destructively playing with the image in the
meantime.  An example would be in-situ plugin previews.  Balancing
freezes and thaws and ensuring image consistancy is the responsibility
of the caller.
