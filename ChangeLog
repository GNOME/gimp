	Merged from trunk:

	* app/base/tile-private.h
        * app/base/tile-swap.c: Move the LARGE_SEEK and LARGE_TRUNCATE
        macros from tile-private.h to tile-swap.c as they aren't used

2007-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-render.c (box_filter): shift only

	cursor drawing is disabled for the paint tools.

	* app/tools/gimpsourcetool.c (gimp_source_tool_draw): pass FALSE
