	* app/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/image_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: always return a thumbnail of at least
	1 pixel width and height so plug-ins don't have to check the return 
	value. Seems to fix bug #50867, please test!

2001-10-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c (sobel_dialog): corrected initial setting
	of toggle button. Thanks to floemker@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE for
	spotting this one (bug #61525).

2001-10-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrush.c (gimp_brush_load): don't crash on invalid brush
	files (fixes bug #61418).

2001-08-29  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c:
	Fixed bug which would sometimes cause there to be a small gap
	between lines drawn using the shift click feature of the 
	painting tools.

2001-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/trochoid.scm: 
	fixed parameter description (bug #59760).

2001-08-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README.i18n: added a section that mentions the GNOME translation
	project that coordinates translation efforts in the GNOME CVS tree.

2001-08-14  Andras Timar <timar@gnome.hu>

	* tips/gimp_tips.hu.txt: Fixing typos.

2001-08-11  Emese Kovacs <emese@gnome.hu>

	* tips/gimp_tips.hu.txt: Updated Hungarian translation

2001-08-07  Emese Kovacs <emese@gnome.hu>

        * tips/Makefile.am|makefile.mingw: Added gimp_tips.hu.txt to the
	targets. 

	* tips/gimp_tips.hu.txt: Added Hungarian tips file. 

2001-08-01  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* plug-ins/common/tga.c: Fix for small TGA2 files

2001-07-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING
	* autogen.sh: we require gettext version 0.38.

2001-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.2.2 release.

2001-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added zh_TW.Big5 to ALL_LINGUAS (traditional chinese).

2001-07-25  Shirasaki Yasuhiro  <yasuhiro@gnome.gr.jp>

	* tips/gimp_tips.ja.txt: file (kanji) encoding adjustment.

2001-07-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tips/gimp_tips.ja.txt: 
	updated japanese translation by Iccii <iccii@hotmail.com>.

2001-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_filter_foreach.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_cmd_guides.c
	* plug-ins/sel2path/pxl-outline.c: marked missing strings for 
	translation (patch from Iccii <iccii@hotmail.com>).

2001-07-22  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* plugins/common/despeckle.c: Reflect my fix from 2001-03-01
	(range limits) in script-fu comments.

2001-07-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: removed "Baseline JPEG" toggle button from
	the GUI because it allowed to trigger a bug in libjpeg that caused a 
	crash (bug #57727). The non-interactive version still has the baseline
	option so scripts don't have to change.

2001-07-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added lt (Lithuanian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2001-07-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed ro from ALL_LINGUAS because the translation
	was for the gimp HEAD branch and po files were missing.

2001-07-17  Marius Andreiana  <mandreiana@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added ro (Romanian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2001-07-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/display.pdb (display_new_invoker): removed 
	unnecessary check for gimage->layers. Creating a display for an empty
	image is a valid operation.

2001-07-14  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

        * tips/Makefile.am|makefile.mingw: Added gimp_tips.tr.txt to the
	targets and re-ordered the tips files listings.

	* tips/gimp_tips.tr.txt: Added Turkish tips file from Alper Ersoy.

2001-07-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c: a fix for bug #57217 based on a patch from
	Raphael Quinet.

2001-07-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gap/gap_lib.c (p_file_copy): open files in binary mode. 
	A patch from Wolfgang Hofer that possibly fixes bug #52890.

2001-07-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: added ChangeLog.pre-1-2 to EXTRA_DIST (makes a good 
	read on long winter evenings).

	* tools/Makefile.am: added gimppath2svg.py to EXTRA_DIST.

2001-07-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/xwd.c: applied patch from Peter Kirchgessner 
	<peter@kirchgessner.net> that fixes bug #56830.

2001-07-02  Nick Lamb  <njl195@zepler.org.uk>

	* plug-ins/common/png.c: Change PNG defaults (no 1.0 gamma chunk)

2001-07-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/helpbrowser.c: removed special handling of 
	undocumented filters, added support for anchors in URLs.

2001-07-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/*/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl: added -I$(top_srcdir)/intl to INCLUDES.
	This will hopefully fix #51823 without breaking it for other platforms.

2001-07-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/perspective_tool.c
	* app/rotate_tool.c
	* app/scale_tool.c
	* app/shear_tool.c: changed location of help files.

2001-07-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.in: take glib_cflags and glib_libs from glib-config instead
	of using ugly sed hacks to strip it out of gtk_cflags and gtk_libs.
	This should fix 'gimptool --cflags-noui'.

2001-07-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* acconfig.h: we forgot to add HAVE_FINITE and HAVE_ISFINITE here
	(bug #56918).

2001-06-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/global_edit.c: attach default comment to image created by
	"Paste As New" (addresses bug #51164).

2001-06-30  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: More error recovery.  Not perfect.  Adequate.

2001-06-29  Adam D. Moss <adam@gimp.org>

	* app/convert.c: Make it even harder to trigger those
	impossible-to-reach assertions, and handle things more gracefully
	when we do reach them.  :P  Also removed some redundant calculations
	and crufty structure elements.  Fixes bug #52264.

2001-06-27  Daniel Egger <egger@suse.de>

	* README.i18n: Corrected some typos and revised a sentence.
	Thanks to Branko Collin for noticing the glitches.

2001-06-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser_utils.c: subtle dialog layout tweaks.

2001-06-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimptool.1.in: fixed gimptool manpage which was still refering to 
	directories we used to use with GIMP version 1.0.
	
	* app/image_cmds.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: always allocate a full colormap for
	indexed images, even if someone sets the number of colors to zero.
	Fixes bug #56561.

2001-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpmath.h: do not include math.h conditionally since this
	change broke a lot of plug-ins that do not include config.h before
	including gimp.h and it won't work for third-party plug-ins either.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c
	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c: use gimp_ui_init() which sets
	the default colormap and visual in an attempt to fix bug #50715.

2001-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/ChangeLog
	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntext.[ch]: merged changes done by plug-in 
	author into our source, thus upgrading GDynText to version 1.5.4.
	This should fix bug #55341 (dynamic text layer renames itself).

2001-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_apply.c
	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c
	* plug-ins/common/papertile.c
	* plug-ins/common/vinvert.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/textured-logo.scm: applied a patch from
	"Iccii" <iccii@hotmail.com> that marks a bunch of leftover strings 
	for translation (bug #56490).

2001-06-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: fixed a longstanding display update bug by
	applying the same fix to gdisplays_update_full() that has been
	applied to gdisplays_update_area() ages ago.

	* app/layers_dialog.c: no need to gdisplays_flush_now() when
	deleting the layer, gdisplays_flush() works fine now.

2001-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/histogram_tool.c: use GINT_TO_POINTER and GPOINTER_TO_INT 
	macros for the gimp_option_menu's user_data.

2001-06-20  David Neary  <dneary@eircom.net>

	* configure.in
	* libgimp/gimpmath.h: Added a fix which tests for ieee NaN
	functions and includes them as the correct name if they
	exist. This closes bug #51822. This fix is courtesy of
	<bugzilla-gnome@thewrittenword.com>.

2001-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 1.2.2, removed some 
	unneeded sed hacks and added a new one to fix generation of 
	plug-ins/perl/po/Makefile.
	
	* plug-ins/common/ps.c: applied gimp-kirchgessner-010619-0, a patch
	from Peter Kirchgessner that should fix bug #51403.

2001-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/print/escputil.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-escp2.c: one more gimp-print update.
	(relocated the tag in the gimp-print CVS).

2001-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: do not use a drawable_ID from the last run
	since this drawable might have changed or even vanished. The latter
	case caused a crash (bug #37761).

2001-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c (file_open): do not use the global variable 
	load_procs used by the file open dialog to store the user setting for 
	the filetype. This setting is now only used if files are opened thru 
	the file open dialog and not when opened using DND or other methods. 
	Fixes bug #51722.

2001-06-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c: specify encoding for char
	cell font and use gdk_fontset_load() instead of gfk_font_load().
	Fixes bug #50522 for me and hopefully does not break things for you.
	Please test the Script-Fu console.

2001-06-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: applied patch found in bug-report
	#52981 that fixes wrong handling of GRAYA drawables in the 
	Newsprint GUI.

	* app/crop.c: do not update info_window on redraw but only on motion.
	This is a very lame but simple fix for bug #38737. A correct fix
	would be to change the Crop tool not to abuse the info_window, but
	I consider this too much change for 1.2.
	
2001-06-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/selection.h: Selection->timer must be a guint, not a gint.

	May address #10498 "Marching Ants die untimely deaths" but I
	cannot verify that since #10498 never happened here. Chances are
	however good that this is #10498 related, as it usually occurs
	after several hours of usage and may well be a signed<->unsigned
	overflow problem.

2001-06-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: marked missing string for translation.
	
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/land.scm: corrected wrong parameter 
	description. 

	Thanks to "Iccii" <iccii@hotmail.com> for his patch.

2001-06-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/print/README
	* plug-ins/print/RELNOTES
	* plug-ins/print/gimp_main_window.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-dither.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-escp2.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-printers.c
	* plug-ins/print/print-util.c: updated to the latest CVS version
	of the gimp-print stable branch (4.0.5).

2001-06-15  Austin Donnelly  <austin@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: initialise gdisp->cursor_x and gdisp->cursor_y
	    to 0 in gdisplay_new() so that we don't get floating point
	    exceptions when attempting to translate to screen co-ords in
	    gdisplay_update_cursor().  Fixes critical Bug #56237.

2001-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: unref layers and channels instead of sinking them
	when destroying an image.

2001-06-02  Garry R. Osgood <grosgood@rcn.com>
	
	* tips/gimp_tips.txt: English language typo at line 50: it -> is.
	* app/crop.c Fix for bugs #9350 and #54838 which prevents Gimp
	crash on floating selections; issue of bad cropping raised by
	#9350 reporter dyfa@addict.de still extant because a scheme
	script cannot select to crop on a layer, and a crop with respect
	to the entire image may be completely disjoint with respect to
	the layer on which a user is applying an effect. Such
	condition leads to the reported script-fu error, which is less
	severe than an application crash.

2001-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tips/gimp_conseils.fr.txt
	* tips/gimp_tips.de.txt
	* tips/gimp_tips.txt: fixed an error pointed out by Branko Collin:
	Bucket Fill tool uses BG color when pressing Ctrl, not Shift. Someone
	needs to fix the other languages.

2001-05-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: allow for automake 1.4-p1 and similar version numbers.
	(fix ported from HEAD branch)
	
	* app/module_db.c: applied a patch from Austin Donnelly that fixes 
	bug #55050 (button without label in Module Browser).

2001-05-06 Garry R. Osgood <grosgood@rcn.com>

	* app/histogram_tool.c:
	histogram_tool_initialize() now aligns its option menu
	and internal state to GIMP_HISTOGRAM_VALUE when it is
	given a channel. Prior, only hid option menu, causing
	crash reported in #54131 when internals attempted to
	generate histogram on non-existent drawable component. 
	Closes #54131.

2001-04-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Plugged some memleaks:

	* app/gimpbrush.c: don't leak all pixmaps.

	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c: free all the pipe's brushes here.

2001-04-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/perl/examples/terral_text: fixed syngin's fix

	* plug-ins/perl/examples/image_tile
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/yinyang: 
	applied gimp-kirchgessner-010422-0.patch which fixes problems with 
	invalid number of parameters passed to some functions.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/interp_sliba.c: fixed problems with strbreakup 
	reported by Mike Kelly <mike@csuchico.edu> (bugs #52383 and #52385)

2001-04-23  Mel Boyce  <syngin@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/perl/examples/terral_text: Fixed typo.

Sat Apr 21 17:04:34 PDT 2001 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4: updated libtool stuff

	* configure.in: more #undefs so jpeglib.h test works

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: speedup patch from Ernst Lippe
	<ernstl@planet.nl> (tile cache size optimization)

2001-04-11  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>:
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c:
	GIMP couldn't read bmp files with a bad chunk. This kind of files 
	can be found in OS/2 1.x.

2001-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/posterize.c
	* plug-ins/common/fractaltrace.c
	* plug-ins/common/illusion.c

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/general.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_cmd_guides.c
	* plug-ins/mosaic/mosaic.c
	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: applied a patch from Iccii that marks a 
	few leftover strings for translation. People, update your translations!

2001-04-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.c
	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c
	* plug-ins/common/mpeg.c
	* plug-ins/common/png.c
	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c
	* plug-ins/common/xpm.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c
	* plug-ins/twain/twain.c
	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: s/INIT_I18N/INIT_I18N_UI/. Should
	fix problems with font encodings for russian users (and probably
	others).

2001-04-06  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>:
        * plugins/common/tga.c: Fixed bug #52728 - problem in loading
	compressed and uncompressed 15 bit tga, compressed 16 bit tga
	files and removed a false warning for 32 bit tga files.

2001-04-03  Matt Wilson  <msw@redhat.com>

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_main): _always_ set up the other locale
	categories, otherwise many C libraries will blow away characters
	outside of the POSIX charset.  Still use the C locale for
	LC_NUMERIC, though. r: yosh@gimp.org

2001-03-22  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        * app/bucket_fill.c: Bucket fill threshold=0 must be allowed.

2001-03-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: applied patch from 
	Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> which fixes wrong array size.

2001-03-13  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* configure.in: Added "tr" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2001-03-12  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libgimp/makefile.msc: Add missing object files. The import
	library for the intl library is now called just intl.

	* libgimp/makefile.msc (gimpi_OBJECTS): Typo.

	* app/makefile.msc (gimp_OBJECTS): Remove objects corresponding to
	removed source files. Update name of import library for the intl
	library. Add missing objects.

	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* app/gimpbrushpipe.c
	* app/patterns.c: Include <glib.h> early for G_OS_WIN32.

	* app/dialog_handler.h: Change the #ifdef logic: Declare
	dialog_register and dialog_unregister always, but mark for export
	only when compiling dialog_handler.c. That way MSVC won't complain
	when dialog_handler.c calls dialog_unregister without it
	being defined, and also the declarations and definitions will
	have identical attributes (both marked for export). Whew. Gcc
	is a bit less picky, it accepts a declaration that isn't marked
	for export even if the definition is.

	* app/dialog_handler.c: Change comment correspondingly.

2001-03-11  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c: Applied patch from
	Austin Donnelly to fix rendering of the topmost
	scanline.

2001-03-11  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: Enhance to also be able to paste
	BI_BITFIELDS images, 16- or 32-bit. Global indentation and spacing
	fix (use cvs diff -bu2 to see the real differences).

2001-03-10  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/makefile.mingw.in: Add some missing standard plug-ins,
	and some new unofficial ones. Don't define -Drandom=g_random_int,
	the RAND_FUNC in config.h.win32 takes care of this. Define GIMP
	for mathmap.

	* user_install.bat: Copy the default palettes to the user's
	palette directory.

	* app/dialog_handler.c: Define __DIALOG_HANDLER_C_, not
	__DIALOG_HANDLER_C__, to match the #ifndef in
	dialog_handler.h. Add comment why __DIALOG_HANDLER_C_ is needed.

2001-03-04  Zbigniew Chyla  <cyba@gnome.pl>

	* app/commands.c (image_scale_callback),
	libgimp/gimpchainbutton.c (gimp_chain_button_destroy),
	libgimp/gimpcolorbutton.c (gimp_color_button_destroy):
	Move variable assignments out of assertions to allow compilation
	with "G_DISABLE_ASSERT" and/or "G_DISABLE_CHECKS" defined.

2001-03-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/preferences_dialog.c (prefs_save_callback): applied a patch
	from David Odin <David.Odin@bigfoot.com> that fixes a typo in the code.

2001-03-01  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* ChangeLog:
	* ChangeLog.pre-1-2: Move the pre-1.2 changes out
	to their own new file.

2001-03-01  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

	* app/fileops.c: Applied fix from Dave Neary to fix
	bug #37633 "File->Revert doesn't resize canvas". Not
	the best fix but quite effective.

2001-03-01  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

        * plugins/common/despeckle.c: Fixed black_level range.
        Valid range should be -1..255, not 0..256, because comaparison
	is > and <=. Bug became visible after last Martin Weber's fix.
        There must be for both black and white levels one extra value
	to cover all numbers 0..255.

2001-02-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/header.c: applied patch from Chuck Mason 
	<chuckjr@unbounded.com> that fixes wrong output of header plug-in.

        On request of Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>.
	* plugins/common/despeckle.c: Fixed comparison *sort_ptr > black_level.
	Only adopting white_level had a visual effect. This fix causes
	that also adopting blck_level works also.

2001-02-07  Daniel Egger  <egger@suse.de>

        * configure.in: Changed link order in gtkxmhtml check
	to fix bug #12653.
		
2001-02-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* data/brushes/hsparks.gih
	* data/brushes/vine.gih: seems we had forgotten to convert these
	to the new format.

2001-02-05  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphistogram.c: Applied patches by Roel Schroeven
	<rschroev@yahoo.com> that fix histogram with mask calculation bug and
	median calculation bug.

2001-02-03  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@eikonex.org>

	* tips/gimp_conseils.fr.txt: Updated with suggestions from
	Gérard Delafond <g.delafond@medsyn.fr>

2001-01-30  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "nn" to ALL_LINGUAS.
	
2001-01-28  Asbjorn Pettersen  <asbjornP@dualog.no>

	* modules/gimpmodregister.h: add #include <libgimp/gimptypes.h>
	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c (load_image): fix bug loading bz2 files (OS/2)
	* app/module_db.c: OS/2 fix. remove gimp_color_display_register(),,

2001-01-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpwidgets.c: fixed wrong for-loop boundary that caused 
	the gimp_mem_size_entry not to accept values larger than 1023 MB.

Sun Jan 21 21:54:57 PST 2001 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.2.1 release

2001-01-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphelp.c: disabled debugging output.

2001-01-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/palette.c: plugged memory leaks.

2001-01-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated and changed .gimp to .gimp-1.2
	
	* configure.in: changed .gimp to .gimp-1.2

Mon Jan 15 17:17:33 PST 2001 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/fileops.c: correct spelling of "lose" in revert dialog

2001-01-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimp.spec.in: corrected FTP location of gimp

2001-01-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: added note about autogenerated files (merged from HEAD)

2001-01-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c
	* app/plug-in.c: added some sanity checks for passed string pointers
	to various public functions in an attempt to fix bug #37622. I'm not
	sure if this fixes the bug since I can not reproduce it.

2001-01-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sharpen.c: applied a patch from Jerome Zago 
	<jzago@ifhamy.insa-lyon.fr> that fixes a longstanding bug in the
	sharpen filter which sometimes got the last line wrong. 
	Fixes bug #34155

2001-01-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/aa.c: removed .html from the list of file extensions
	since it clashes with the GTM plug-in.

2001-01-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: blue is (0,0,1), not (0,0,2)

2001-01-10  Szabolcs Ban

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c: fixed typo. 
	s/Treshold/Threshold/

2001-01-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrushlist.c
	* app/gradient.c
	* app/palette.c
	* app/patterns.c: check for NULL pointers before doing strcmp on
	default names. The default names for brushes, patterns, ... can 
	be NULL if they were not set in a readable gimprc file.

	* app/gimprc.c: warn the user if the systemwide gimprc couldn't be
	read.

2001-01-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/title-header.scm (script-fu-title-header):
	Correct args to gimp-color-picker. Thanks to Piet van Oostrum.

2001-01-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/levels.c: reverted the behaviour of the "Reset" button back
	to resetting the current channel only. Resetting all channels was
	broken and IMHO cannot work the way it was implemented.

2001-01-02  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/paint_core.c: use floor() before casting to gint when 
	calculating the current brush coordinates. Fixes the jagged brush 
	stroke when stroking a path that leaves the image at the top or left
	edge (bug #6043).
	
2001-01-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimphelp.c (gimp_idle_help): s/welcome.html/introduction.html/
	Fixes #36456.

2001-01-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gdyntext/gdyntextcompat.h: also check for GIMP's minor
	version when deciding if to add a missing PDB wrapper.

2000-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
            Simon Budig <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpbrush.c
	* plug-ins/common/gih.c: explicitely cast offset to (off_t) when 
	seeking back. Should fix the problems reading grayscale BrushPipes 
	on IRIX.

2000-12-29  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* config.h.win32: RAND_FUNC must not return negative values. Can't
	use g_random_int as is, must use g_random_int_range (0, G_MAXINT).

	* plug-ins/flame/cmap.c: Include glib.h for G_MAXINT.

2000-12-29  Simon Budig   <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c  Argh - converting 16bit colors
	(from DnD-Source) to 8 bit must not be done by dividing by 0xff (255)!
	divide by 256 instead...

2000-12-29  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/makefile.mingw.in: Build as a windowing application (-mwindows).

	* app/gimp.sym: Remove the color display functions that are gone.

	* plug-ins/makefile.mingw.in: Build two versions of the tiff
	plug-in: tiff (with TIFF_LZW_LIBS), and tiff_nolzw (with
	TIFF_NOLZW_LIBS).

2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channel.c
	* app/layer.c: use gtk_object_sink() instead of gtk_object_unref()
	when deleting a layer or channel since only floating objects should
	be destroyed this way. A layer or channel that has been attached
	to an image shall never be deleted.
	
	* app/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: reenabled the gimp_layer_delete() PDB
	function since it might be useful under rare circumstances.
	
2000-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channel_cmds.c
	* app/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpchannel_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.c
	* plug-ins/common/warp.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_exchange_image.c
	* plug-ins/gap/gap_range_ops.c
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/bricks
	* plug-ins/perl/examples/glowing_steel
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/channel.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb

	Two of the gimp-perl scripts used to call gimp_layer_delete() after
	gimp_image_remove_layer(). This will fail since the layer is already 
	scheduled for destruction by removing it from the associated image or
	by deleting that image. It is thus dangerous and superfluous to export
	this feature through the PDB. The gimp_layer_delete() is hereby
	obsolete and does nothing any longer. I have removed the code calling
	it from all over the place (it was commented out in almost all places).

	The PDB help for gimp_channel_delete() now explicetly tells the user 
	about the proper usage of the procedure.
	
2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c: the size of the string holding the
	image data was one byte too short (we forgot the trailing '\0').
	Reported by <goswin.brederlow@student.uni-tuebingen.de>

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gimpimage.c: gimp_image_merge_layers(): apply the layer mask
	only if layer->apply_mask is TRUE.

2000-12-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/layers_dialog.c: layers_dialog_scroll_index(): don't fiddle
	around with magic numbers when calculating the layer widget's
	height but simply ask one of them for it's allocation.  Fixes
	positioning when the preview is smaller than the layer widget list
	item.

2000-12-27  Tomas Ogren  <stric@ing.umu.se>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_storage.c: Remove the last comma in
	  an enum, xlc barfs

Tue Dec 26 11:10:23 PST 2000 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/patterns.c: fix fd leak on loading

Sun Dec 24 23:18:32 PST 2000 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Made 1.2.0 release
