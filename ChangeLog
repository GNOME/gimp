2005-02-21  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/text/gimpfont-utils.[ch]: be smarter about finding trailing
	numbers that look like sizes, so we don't have spurious commas.

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c: As an optimization, figure out if
	pango needs a workaround, and if not, just call it directly.

2005-02-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (toolbox_area_notify): apply evil
	size_request hacks to the color/image/foo areas' wrapbox because
	its child requisition/allocation code is apparently broken. Works
	around bug #162500.

2005-02-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* plug-ins/common/emboss.c: fixed emboss on small images (bug #168022).

	Merged from HEAD:

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: Ignore guides at or beyond

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c
	* app/core/gimp-templates.[ch] (gimp_templates_migrate): if
	migrating templaterc from ~/.gimp-2.0, do a case-insensitive match
	on template names to accommodate for the fact that we changed the
	spelling of some default templates between 2.0 and 2.2.

2005-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_create_layer): block
	the "active-layer-changed" callback while anchoring the floating
	selection so the callback doesn't reset the text tool in the
	middle of adding a new text layer. Fixes bug #166829.

2005-02-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (mng_save_image): write a DEFI chunk to

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderergradient.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_gradient_render): don't attempt to read beyond
	the pre-calculated render buffers, even if the gradient somehow
	has out-of-bounds values. Fixes the crash reported in bug #167604.

2005-02-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: reverted the last change
	since it changes the script API. Such a change must not be done in
	the stable branch.

2005-02-16  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: Added constants

2005-02-08  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfont-utils.[ch]: new function to workaround pango
	bug #166540, by tacking on a ',' to font names that end in numbers,
	so pango_font_description_from_string doesn't interpret it as a size.

	* app/text/Makefile.am: add above files.

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c
	* app/text/gimptext-compat.c: use new function.

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c

2005-02-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c (gimp_image_convert): relax/rigor
	the floating selection around the convert operations so color
	analysis for indexed conversion works on the floating selection's
	drawable original pixels, and not on the composited one.
	Fixes bug #165342.

2005-01-28  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c: set preview bounds correctly

2005-01-23  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_file.c: removed redundant line that tried to
	display a filename without calling gimp_filename_to_utf8.

2005-01-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.4, interface_age 4.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* HACKING
	* Makefile.am
	* acinclude.m4
	* autogen.sh: applied (modified) patch from Raphaël Quinet that
	allows to build GIMP from CVS without having gtk-doc installed.
	If you need to do this, pass --disable-gtk-doc to autogen.sh.

	* configure.in: removed --disable-devel-docs option since it has
	become obsolete now.

	* devel-docs/Makefile.am: require gtk-doc when running 'make dist'.

2005-01-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	GTK_STOCK_SAVE for the save dialog (bug #164864).

2005-01-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	(gimp_enum_value_get_help): don't crash if gimp_enum_get_desc()

2005-01-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	(gimp_component_editor_button_press): call gimp_image_flush() after

	channel. Fixes bug #164195.

2005-01-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: fix up indentation.

2005-01-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

2005-01-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: applied (a slightly modified version of)
	a patch from Nils Philippsen that makes sure that the EXIF

	maximum size.  Fixes bug #164087.

2005-01-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

2005-01-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpparasitelist.c (parasite_serialize): use
	gimp_config_writer_data() to write the parasite data because
	it's binary and can contain '\0'.

	(gimp_parasite_list_deserialize): use gimp_scanner_parse_data() to
	read it. Still accepts the old file format for backward
	compatibility. Fixes bug #163131.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_coordinates_callback):

2005-01-17  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c (pressure_options_gui): added a

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added GIMP_UNDO_INK.

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: added virtual function
	GimpPaintCore::push_undo() and call it.

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-undo.[ch]: made it the default
	implementation.

	* app/paint/gimpink-blob.[ch]: added blob_duplicate().

	* app/paint/gimpink.[ch]: added a "start_blob" (just like
	GimpPaintCore::start_coords) which gets set whenever we start a
	new stroke or line. Removed ink->lastx and ink->lasty because
	they are the same as paint_core->last_coords.

	* app/paint/Makefile.am
	* app/paint/gimpink-undo.[ch]: new files implementing an
	undo step for ink which restores the last blob used along
	with the whole ink state. Fixes bug #163670.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/retinex.c (run): fixed check for number of

	should fix bug #163877 (merged from HEAD)
	
2005-01-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	Splitting GimpItem::convert() into two virtual functions was
	apparently buggy over-engineering. Reverted that stuff and
	implement item conversion much simpler:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: have a single virtual function,
	GimpItem::convert(), which takes a newly duplicated item and the
	destination image.

	(gimp_item_convert): simply call GimpItem::convert() on the result
	of gimp_item_duplicate().

	(gimp_item_real_convert): set the item's new image.

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_convert)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_convert): changed
	accordingly and chain up after, not before doing our own stuff
	so the old image is still available as item->image for stuff
	like colormap conversion. Fixes bug #163879.

2005-01-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	Made the file open and save dialogs use the last used folder
	instead of defaulting to current directory. Fixes bug #162385.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch] (gimp_file_dialog_set_uri):
	removed this function because it had no functionality except
	creating usability problems.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: use gtk_file_chooser_set_uri()
	instead but *only* if we already have an uri from an alread open
	image or the document hinstory.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_image): set
	the file chooser's uri only if we have an uri from the image
	itself. Leave the current folder untouched otherwise and just set
	the current name (e.g. "Untitled").

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c (file_save_dialog_save_image): on
	successful save, remember the used uri by attaching it to the
	"gimp" instance.

	(file_save_dialog_new): set the last saved uri's folder on the
	newly created file save dialog.

2005-01-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod/slib.c (help): removed wrong URL from

2005-01-10  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c: #include <time.h> to make sure all
	the types are there for the alsa headers. Should address bug
	#163593.

2005-01-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx-installer.c

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c (gimp_action_view_new): connect to

	waiting for a second click. Fixes bug #163385.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c (gimp_dialog_factories_toggle):

	bug #162663).

2005-01-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch (fix by Shlomi Fish):

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/frosty-logo.scm: made sure the shadow
	is given enough space and then truncated instead of translated to
	the center of the image, thus preventing the display of shadows
	with a completely horizontal or vertical edge (fixes bug #132145).

2005-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/actions/plug-in-commands.c (plug_in_run_cmd_callback):

	possibly long running calculations are being done. Fixes bug #163084.

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: round displayed resolution
	instead of just casting to integer values. Use image size limits
	from libgimpbase/gimplimits.h instead of some arbitrary numbers.

2005-01-02  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/clothify.py

2004-12-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use the orininal string if
	plug_in_actions_check_translation() fails instead of bailing out.
	Fixes bug #162590.

2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* tools/kernelgen.c: fixed rounding so that all brush kernels are
	created with a constant sum of 256.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h: regenerated.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask): use
	the constant defined in app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h. Should
	give a tiny speedup.

2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preview.c (render_rgb_image): use the proper
	image type and rowstride. Fixes bug #162592.

2004-12-30  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: give correct arguments to
	gimp_coordinates_new().  Fixes problem described in

	bug #162443.

2004-12-28  Bill Skaggs

	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: add alpha channels to layers
	when decomposing as layers.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.1 release.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch] (gimp_install_procedure, gimp_install_temp_proc):
	renamed menu_path parameter to menu_label and added a pointer to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register()

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c (gimp_size_box_constructor): removed
	unused variables.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	reverted Bill's change since it is obviously not the right fix.
	Allocate the array larger to avoid the crash. We need to
	investigate bug #161323 further.

2004-12-27  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	don't set array outside its bounds.  Should fix bug #161323.
	Credit to Robert Ögren for figuring out what was wrong.
	
2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c: if possible, use
	gimp_preview_draw_buffer() so that the selection mask is correctly
	previewed. Minor cleanups.

2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpregioniterator.c: added some checks to avoid
	division by zero.

	zero width or height, fixes bug #162232.

	* app/base/brush-scale.c: remove tabs and trailing
	whitespace.

	as suggested by mitch.

2004-12-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/weave.scm: limit the "Thread
	intensity" parameter to [0..100] because it's used as layer
	opacity. Fixes bug #162182.

2004-12-24  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/actions/documents-commands.c

2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* gimp/app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: fix incorrect Update
	Policy for size entry as pointed out by mitch.

	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c
	* plug-ins/common/whirlpinch.c: make sure tile cache is allocated
	before preview is shown -- significant speedup in some cases,
	minimal in others.

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c: give it a tile cache (didn't
	have one).  Still very slow but a little better.
	
2004-12-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c (despeckle_median): don't call
	gimp_progress_update() for each and every pixel. Every few rows
	should be enough. Fixes bug #162129.

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: set progress to 1.0 when done, not to 100.

2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: set up tile cache before
	creating dialog -- major speedup in preview.
	
2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* gimp/app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: use gimp_coordinates_new()
	instead of duplicating a lot of code.  Fixes bug #161756.
	
	* gimp/app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: small change in 
	chainbutton handling to make above work.

2004-12-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc-frame.[ch]: made plug_in_proc_frame_free()
	a static function.

2004-12-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Item conversion depends on the old *and* the new item type, so
	it can't live in the old item's vtable only:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: split GimpItem::convert() into
	GimpItem::convert_from() (which is called on the old item and
	creates the new item) and GimpItem::convert_to() (which is called
	on the new item). This way functions from the old *and* new items'
	vtables are called and it's possible to convert between item types
	which live on different branches of the class hierarchy or to item
	types which live further down the class tree than the old item.

	(gimp_item_convert): call ::convert_to() on the new item created
	by ::convert_from().

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: changed ::convert() implementation
	to ::convert_from().

	* app/core/gimplayer.c: changed ::convert() to ::convert_to().
	Fixes bug #161877.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/asc2img.scm: removed this script as it
	is broken beyond repair and the functionality is provided by the
	text tool itself.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS: added NEWS for the stable branch (no, we haven't branched
	yet).

	* Makefile.am
	* NEWS.pre-2.2: moved old NEWS here.
	
2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (blur_line): fixed the degenerate case
	where the source image is smaller than the blurred area. This used
	to give artefacts at the borders.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup and micro
	optimizations.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: reverted the last change since it
	introduced artefacts. Even had to increase the border around the
	previewed area. Fixed a bug in unsharp_region() where it was using
	the wrong source region for blurring.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: compute preview for the displayed area
	only, some more code cleanup.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): fixed bug #157910.
	More code cleanup and some trivial optimizations.

2004-12-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	(gradient_editor_actions_update): if the dialog is insensitive,
	disable all actions which modify the gradient. Fixes bug #161411.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.c: update the UI manager
	after setting the dialog sensitive/insensitive so te above works.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region):
	unset the dirty flag on the GimpPixelRgn used to iterate the region.

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c (gimp_pixel_rgn_init): improved docs.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: code cleanup, no real changes.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.1.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: applied patch from
	Yeti that fixes a memory corruption (bug #161729).

2004-12-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.0 release.
