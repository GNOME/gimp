	always call gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder_uri() and

2006-02-01  Matt Wilson  <msw@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/compressor.c (run): file_{gz,bz2}_save takes 5
	parameters, not 4.  Correct the nparams check in non-interactive
	mode.


2006-01-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c (gimp_levels_tool_color_picker_new):

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-new.scm

2006-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c: implement GtkWidget::hide() and set
	the the focus widget to NULL, so a focussed entry emits focus_out
	and its callbacks are invoked immediately (before the call to
	gtk_widget_hide() returns). Fixes crashes and warnings in tool
	dialogs when hitting escape while a spinbutton is being edited.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	(gimp_transform_tool_force_expose_preview): return silently
	instead of warning when being called while the draw tool is not
	active (same scenario as above).

2006-01-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* gimptool-2.0.in: if available use pkg-config to determine

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: applied a patch from Mukund that fixes
	handling of EXIF data when preview is enabled (bug #303383).

2006-01-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush.pdb (gimp-brush-set-spacing): allow to
	change the spacing of brushes the user doesn't have write access
	to. The user interface allows to do that as well.

	* app/pdb/brush_cmds.c: regenerated.

2005-12-12  Michael Schumacher  <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod/slib.c: added a fix for the script-fu
	crash in chinese (and maybe other) locales. Applied to both
	branches. Fixes bug #163212. 

2005-12-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpstrokedesc.c (gimp_stroke_desc_new): fall back to
	the paintbrush if we can't get the paint method from the active
	tool (because there is no active tool). Fixes bug #323778.

2005-12-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/url.c (load_image): : added "-v" to the wget

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c (gimp_colormap_editor_draw_cell):
	plugged a memleak.

2005-11-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_mask_bounds):
	return TRUE only if the selection intersects with the viewport, as
	expected by gimp_display_shell_selection_invis(), which is the
	only caller of this function. Fixes bug #319029.

2005-11-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-new.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-new-percent.scm: look at the
	image's width/height, not the drawable's. Fixes bug #320933.

2005-11-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/config/gimpconfig-dump.c: fixed typo.

2005-11-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c (gimp_prop_text_buffer_callback):
	use g_utf8_strlen() to measure the length of the text.

2005-10-31  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* gimptool-win32.c.in: Drop unnecessary <sys/stat.h>.
	(gtk_config): Drop the GIMP 1.2.x and gtk+-1-3-win32-production
	support.
	(get_cflags): Output GIMP's -I switch before GTK's CFLAGS. Use
	"include/gimp-2.0" instead of just "include".
	(get_libs, get_libs_noui): Update the list of libraries to match
	reality, use GIMP_API_VERSION in library names.
	(get_sys_plugin_dir): Use GIMP_PLUGIN_VERSION and not
	GIMP_MAJOR_VERSION.GIMP_MINOR_VERSION in the plug-in folder name.

2005-10-27  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.h: declare component_pixels,

2005-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.10, interface_age 10.

2005-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.9 release.

	* autogen.sh: prefer newer versions of automake over older ones.

2005-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c (gimp_dockable_realize): create the
	title window as GDK_WINDOW_CHILD, not GDK_WINDOW_TEMP.

2005-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpimage-contiguous-region.c
	(gimp_image_contiguous_region_by_color): the color samples are
	always RGB or RGBA, so always compare 3 or 4 bytes of pixel data,
	and not just the number of bytes of the drawable/projection.
	Fixes "select by color" on GRAYA (bug #319683).

2005-10-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c (title_changed): replace newlines

2005-10-06  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c: always use RLE if horz or

2005-10-04  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_shade.c: Don't add foreground

2005-09-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/gqbist.c: use a single random number generator

2005-09-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.c (gimp_enum_get_value): ref the enum
	class instead of only peeking at it.

2005-09-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_new): applied
	patch from Robert Ögren that works around problem creating guides
	with a tablet on Windows by enabling extension events for the
	rulers.  Fixes the first problem described in bug #168516.

2005-09-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): reordered checks for
	the modifiers pressed on <Tab> so NumLock and friends don't
	interfere. Fixes bug #317118.

2005-09-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/svg.c: corrected version check (bug #314400).

2005-09-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_groups): s/QuickMask/Quick Mask/
	Fixes bug #316569.

2005-09-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_response):
	bail out if the action_area is insensitive. Ignores attempts to
	close the window while the script is running. Fixes bug #308662.

2005-09-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c	(gimp_iscissors_tool_button_release):
	use gimp_draw_tool_on_handle() to figure if we need to close the
	path. Makes sure that the anchor's sensitive area matches its size
	on screen. Fixes bug #134250.

2005-09-09  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* gimptool-win32.c.in (get_prefix, maybe_append_exe)
	* libgimpbase/gimpdatafiles.c (is_script): Do what I say
	and use g_ascii_strcasecmp() instead of g_strcasecmp().

2005-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpchannel-combine.c (gimp_channel_combine_ellipse):
	use gimp_rectangle_intersect() instead of just looking at the
	passed in w,h to figure whether nothing needs to be done. While
	the algorithm does nicely with an entirely out-of-image ellipse,
	the channel's bounds were set to a rectangle of zero width or
	height, which caused subsequent calls to gimp_channel_bounds() to
	return broken bounds. Fixes bug #315417.

	(gimp_channel_combine_rect)
	(gimp_channel_combine_mask): use gimp_rectangle_intersect() here
	too instead of the usual unclear CLAMPing on x1,y1,x2,y2.

2005-09-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/dialogs/stroke-dialog.c (stroke_dialog_new): use

	Cygwin (bug #314893).

2005-08-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/svg.c: deal with SVG API change. This is a
	compile-time check and thus somewhat ugly because it requires a
	recompile of the plug-in when updating librsvg to 2.11.0 or newer.
	Fixes bug #314400.

2005-08-26  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c (plug_in_prep_for_exec, plug_in_open):
	Instead of passing a child_setup function whose body is ifdeffed
	out on Win32 to g_spawn_async(), pass NULL for child_setup on
	Win32. Newer g_spawn_async() implementations on Win32 warn if
	child_setup functions are attempted to be used, as they don't make
	sense because without any fork(), they are called in the parent
	process.

2005-08-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/dicom.c: use an empty field instead of "?" for
	the unknown value (bug #313008).

2005-08-24  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* README.win32: Update. Mention should build against GLib 2.4.
	Better late than never.

	* app/core/gimpdata.c (gimp_data_create_filename): Make safer on
	Win32. Not just \ is verboten in file names, also < > / : " | .
	Look for these in the UTF-8 string, so we don't have to do
	double-byte aware scanning of the string after conversion to
	system codepage.

	* libgimpbase/gimpenv.c (gimp_toplevel_directory): [Win32] Use
	_mbsrchr() to search for backslashes in the path to the executable
	file. Doing it with strchr() doesn't work in East Asian locales
	with double-byte codepages, where the trailing byte of double-byte
	character can be a backslash.

2005-08-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_proc_changed):
	when looking for the file extension, only look at the part after
	the last directory separator.

2005-08-18  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/text-circle.scm: Incorporated changes
	made by Daniel P. Stasinski in his text-circle2.scm script. Letters
	are now placed properly for both positive and negative fill angles.
	Fix for bug #144588.

2005-08-17  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* plug-ins/winsnap/Makefile.am (LDADD): Use $(WINDRES) to handle
	cross-compilation.

	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.rc: Refer to the .ico files in
	lowercase, in case cross-compiling.

2005-08-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/fp.c: merged fixes for bug #160032 and bug
	#141032 from HEAD branch.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_callback.c
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_misc.[ch]: redraw the previews if their size
	changes. Fixes bug #172284.

2005-08-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-preview.c (gimp_image_get_new_preview): if the
	offsets of the layer are such that they are just on the border of
	the image, detect that and bail instead of trying to make a
	sub-preview with a 0 dimension. Fixes bug #312144.

2005-08-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	Backported mmx/sse CFLAGS automake gymnastics from HEAD:

	* acinclude.m4: new macro: GIMP_DETECT_CFLAGS; used to detect which
	of a set of compiler options a compiler supports.

	* configure.in: use the above for -fno-strict-aliasing flag. Also,
	use it to detect the presence of -mmmx and -msse, since those are
	needed to compile even MMX/SSE assembly with gcc 4.0. Define
	MMX/SSE_EXTRA_CFLAGS.

	* app/composite/Makefile.am: compile each of the composite flavors
	into their own library, so we can use automake's per-target CFLAGS.
	Use MMX/SSE_EXTRA_CFLAGS in the appropriate places. Build
	libappcomposite.a out of the resulting objects.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-3dnow.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-altivec.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-vis.c
	* app/composite/make-installer.py: move the _init functions into
	the installers, so only actually mmx/sse code gets compiled
	under the appropriate CFLAGS.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-3dnow-installer.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-altivec-installer.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx-installer.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse-installer.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2-installer.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-vis-installer.c: regenerated.

2005-06-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c (procedural_db_execute): if we end up
	without any return values, assume an execution error instead of
	crashing (bug #308904).

2005-06-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: draw the intersection on top of the grid.

2005-05-13  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Don't bother looking for fd_set on Win32, we won't
	find it in sys/types.h or (the nonexistent) sys/select.h
	anyway. (It's in winsock2.h.)

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-server.c: Give it a chance to work
	on Win32 by covering for the differences between the WinSock and
	Unix socket APIs. Use recv() and send() instead of read() and
	write() on sockets. On Win32, use closesocket() for sockets
	instead of close(). Don't use perror() or look at errno after
	socket API errors on Win32. No EINTR failure mode with WinSock 2.
	(print_socket_api_error): New function. On Unix, just call
	perror(). On Win32, call WSAGetLastError() and produce an
	appropriate error message on stderr.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/Makefile.am (WINSOCK_LIBS): Link with the
	winsock2 library, as we compile with the winsock2 header.

	(gimp_composite_lighten_rgba8_rgba8_rgba8_sse2): applied a patch
	from Joao S. O. Bueno Calligaris that changes the SSE2 code to
	load the proper register. Fixes bug #164061.

2005-04-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpmessagebox.c (gimp_message_box_init): unset

2005-04-28  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_shade.c: fix typo messing
	up transparent backgrounds, backported from HEAD where
	it fixed bug #300122, this change should fix bug #302075.

2005-04-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/file/gimprecentlist.c (gimp_recent_list_add_item): close the

2005-04-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw_thumb):
	respect the selection (fixes bug #301523).

2005-04-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintstore.c: removed the "row_deleted" handler
	which used to take care of reinserting the "Empty" item when the
	last row gets deleted. This doesn't work any longer with GTK+ 2.6
	and I see no way to make it work again. Fixes bug #301524.

2005-04-21  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c: pass -dUseCropBox when loading PDF
	files, to match Acrobat Reader's behavior in honoring CropBox over

2005-04-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c (xcf_load_layer): initialize text_layer_flags
	with 0 so it doesn't contain random garbage if the text layer
	flags in the XCF have default values (are not saved at all). Fixes
	bug #301028. Initialize other stuff too for the sake of sanity.

2005-04-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: Redo comment for spot_PSsquare
	and spot_PSdiamonds, since the code was not a derived work in
	the copyright sense. It is a C implementation of the same
	algorithm.

2005-04-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_real_colormap_changed):

	* app/paint/gimpink.c: merged changes to the time-smoother code
	from the HEAD branch. Fixes bug #164272.

2005-04-09  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gifload.c (GetCode): GetDataBlock returns -1 on
	error, so count should be an int, not an unsigned char. Fixes
	bug #173119.

2005-04-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.c: implement color counting without
	changing the image-type to RGB. A save plug-in must not change the
	image.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.c: rewrote preview code to use

2005-04-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.c (gimp_clipboard_format_compare): On
	Win32, move the "bmp" format to the front. Means less conversion
	in most cases, as other apps on Win32 typically provide/want the
	BMP format on the Clipboard. (Actually CF_DIB, but that's the
	same, just without the BMP file header.) See also bug #168173.

2005-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c: applied patch from David Costanzo that
	initializes unspecified pixels in RLE bitmaps. Fixes bug #171562.

2005-03-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.h (Bitmap_Head_Struct)
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c: use a signed long for width and height
	and check that width is > 0 (negative height is allowed and
	handled by our code). Fixes bug #171453.

2005-03-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c: applied a patch from David Costanzo that

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c (gimp_statusbar_push_coords) 
	(gimp_statusbar_set_cursor): use RINT() instead of ROUND() to get
	proper rounding of negative values. Fixes bug #171497.

2005-03-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: change to the Value channel
	if the current channel becomes invalid due to an image mode change.
	Fixes bug #170116.

2005-03-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c: unset "Keep transparency", it is
	not what the user wants if this plug-in is being used.

2005-03-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/actions/dialogs-actions.h: bail out if
	widgets/gimpactiongroup.h has not been included beforehand.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_constructor): disable search for tree
	views so that treeview typeahead doesn't collide with global
	accelerators. Fixes bug #169339 and would suck less if bug #170435
	was fixed.

2005-03-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.c (ico_create_palette): fixed parameter

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c (convert_dialog_palette_filter): don't

2005-03-18  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c:  when converting grayscale

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/tools/gimpellipseselecttool.c

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets-private.c (gimp_widgets_init): disable
	"gtk-alternative-button-order" here, so the plug-ins get it unset
	too. Completely fixes bug #170543.

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_int): removed now redundant code.

2005-03-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_init): disable "gtk-alternative-button-order"
	since we don't provide an alternative button order in this branch.
	Fixes bug #170543.

2005-03-14  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c: Make sure "focus-on-click" property
	exists before setting it on comboboxes (it didn't exist in GTK+ 2.4,
	where the behavior was what we wanted anyway).

2005-03-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c (print_size_dialog_response):

2005-03-05  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/*: Update or add missing copyright and GPL comments.

2005-03-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c (resize_dialog_reset)

2005-02-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpbutton.c (gimp_button_button_press): don't
	reset button->press_state on double clicks because
	GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS always arrive immediately after
	GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, so resetting the state causes the second click
	of a double click to be always interpreted as "clicked", not
	"extended-clicked", breaking e.g. adding of multiple layers by
	shift-clicking the layers dialog's "new" button. Phew, too much
	text for a one-liner bug fix, blah... Spotted by Jimmac.

2005-02-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.5, interface_age 5.

2005-02-21  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/text/gimpfont-utils.[ch]: be smarter about finding trailing
	numbers that look like sizes, so we don't have spurious commas.

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c: As an optimization, figure out if
	pango needs a workaround, and if not, just call it directly.

2005-02-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (toolbox_area_notify): apply evil
	size_request hacks to the color/image/foo areas' wrapbox because

2005-02-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.c (gimp_thumb_init): workaround for
	bug #167973: if no valid home directory exists, use the folder for
	temporary files to store thumbnails.

2005-02-19  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: Ignore guides at or beyond

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c
	* app/core/gimp-templates.[ch] (gimp_templates_migrate): if
	migrating templaterc from ~/.gimp-2.0, do a case-insensitive match
	on template names to accommodate for the fact that we changed the
	spelling of some default templates between 2.0 and 2.2.

2005-02-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_create_layer): block
	the "active-layer-changed" callback while anchoring the floating
	selection so the callback doesn't reset the text tool in the
	middle of adding a new text layer. Fixes bug #166829.

2005-02-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD:

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (mng_save_image): write a DEFI chunk to

	Merged from HEAD:

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderergradient.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_gradient_render): don't attempt to read beyond
	the pre-calculated render buffers, even if the gradient somehow
	has out-of-bounds values. Fixes the crash reported in bug #167604.

2005-02-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: reverted the last change
	since it changes the script API. Such a change must not be done in
	the stable branch.

2005-02-16  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: Added constants

2005-02-08  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfont-utils.[ch]: new function to workaround pango
	bug #166540, by tacking on a ',' to font names that end in numbers,

	* app/text/Makefile.am: add above files.

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c
	* app/text/gimptext-compat.c: use new function.

2005-02-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c (gimp_image_convert): relax/rigor
	the floating selection around the convert operations so color
	analysis for indexed conversion works on the floating selection's
	drawable original pixels, and not on the composited one.
	Fixes bug #165342.

2005-01-28  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

2005-01-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING
	* Makefile.am
	* acinclude.m4

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	(gimp_component_editor_button_press): call gimp_image_flush() after

2005-01-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpparasitelist.c (parasite_serialize): use
	gimp_config_writer_data() to write the parasite data because
	it's binary and can contain '\0'.

	(gimp_parasite_list_deserialize): use gimp_scanner_parse_data() to
	read it. Still accepts the old file format for backward
	compatibility. Fixes bug #163131.

2005-01-17  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added GIMP_UNDO_INK.

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: added virtual function
	GimpPaintCore::push_undo() and call it.

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-undo.[ch]: made it the default
	implementation.

	* app/paint/gimpink-blob.[ch]: added blob_duplicate().

	* app/paint/gimpink.[ch]: added a "start_blob" (just like
	GimpPaintCore::start_coords) which gets set whenever we start a
	new stroke or line. Removed ink->lastx and ink->lasty because
	they are the same as paint_core->last_coords.

	* app/paint/Makefile.am
	* app/paint/gimpink-undo.[ch]: new files implementing an
	undo step for ink which restores the last blob used along
	with the whole ink state. Fixes bug #163670.

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/common/retinex.c (run): fixed check for number of

	should fix bug #163877 (merged from HEAD)
	
2005-01-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	Splitting GimpItem::convert() into two virtual functions was
	apparently buggy over-engineering. Reverted that stuff and
	implement item conversion much simpler:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: have a single virtual function,
	GimpItem::convert(), which takes a newly duplicated item and the
	destination image.

	(gimp_item_convert): simply call GimpItem::convert() on the result
	of gimp_item_duplicate().

	(gimp_item_real_convert): set the item's new image.

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_convert)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_convert): changed
	accordingly and chain up after, not before doing our own stuff
	so the old image is still available as item->image for stuff
	like colormap conversion. Fixes bug #163879.

2005-01-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	Made the file open and save dialogs use the last used folder
	instead of defaulting to current directory. Fixes bug #162385.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch] (gimp_file_dialog_set_uri):
	removed this function because it had no functionality except
	creating usability problems.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: use gtk_file_chooser_set_uri()
	instead but *only* if we already have an uri from an alread open
	image or the document hinstory.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_image): set
	the file chooser's uri only if we have an uri from the image
	itself. Leave the current folder untouched otherwise and just set
	the current name (e.g. "Untitled").

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c (file_save_dialog_save_image): on
	successful save, remember the used uri by attaching it to the
	"gimp" instance.

	(file_save_dialog_new): set the last saved uri's folder on the
	newly created file save dialog.

2005-01-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod/slib.c (help): removed wrong URL from

2005-01-10  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx-installer.c

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c (gimp_action_view_new): connect to

	bug #162663).

2005-01-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch (fix by Shlomi Fish):

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/frosty-logo.scm: made sure the shadow
	is given enough space and then truncated instead of translated to
	the center of the image, thus preventing the display of shadows
	with a completely horizontal or vertical edge (fixes bug #132145).

2005-01-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged from HEAD branch:

	* app/actions/plug-in-commands.c (plug_in_run_cmd_callback):

2005-01-06  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	no longer in a main loop, so the dialog doesn't hang around while
	possibly long running calculations are being done. Fixes bug #163084.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/clothify.py

	* tools/kernelgen.c: fixed rounding so that all brush kernels are
	created with a constant sum of 256.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h: regenerated.

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask): use
	the constant defined in app/paint/gimpbrushcore-kernels.h. Should
	give a tiny speedup.

2004-12-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preview.c (render_rgb_image): use the proper
	image type and rowstride. Fixes bug #162592.

2004-12-30  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: give correct arguments to
	gimp_coordinates_new().  Fixes problem described in
	comment 6 of bug #162387.
	
2004-12-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.2.

2004-12-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c (file_save_dialog_response):
	handle a NULL return value from gtk_file_chooser_get_uri(). Fixes
	bug #162443.

2004-12-28  Bill Skaggs

	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: add alpha channels to layers
	when decomposing as layers.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.1 release.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch] (gimp_install_procedure, gimp_install_temp_proc):
	renamed menu_path parameter to menu_label and added a pointer to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register()

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c (gimp_size_box_constructor): removed
	unused variables.

2004-12-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	reverted Bill's change since it is obviously not the right fix.
	Allocate the array larger to avoid the crash. We need to
	investigate bug #161323 further.

2004-12-27  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_subsample_mask):
	don't set array outside its bounds.  Should fix bug #161323.
	Credit to Robert Ögren for figuring out what was wrong.
	
2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c: if possible, use
	gimp_preview_draw_buffer() so that the selection mask is correctly
	previewed. Minor cleanups.

2004-12-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpregioniterator.c: added some checks to avoid
	division by zero.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: minor cleanups, improved
	API documentation.

2004-12-26  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/core/gimpbrush.c: don't ask for preview with
	zero width or height, fixes bug #162232.

	* app/base/brush-scale.c: remove tabs and trailing
	whitespace.

	as suggested by mitch.

2004-12-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/weave.scm: limit the "Thread
	intensity" parameter to [0..100] because it's used as layer
	opacity. Fixes bug #162182.

	before preview is shown -- significant speedup in some cases,
	minimal in others.

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c: give it a tile cache (didn't
	have one).  Still very slow but a little better.
	
2004-12-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c (despeckle_median): don't call
	gimp_progress_update() for each and every pixel. Every few rows
	should be enough. Fixes bug #162129.

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: set progress to 1.0 when done, not to 100.

2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: set up tile cache before
	creating dialog -- major speedup in preview.
	
2004-12-23  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* gimp/app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: use gimp_coordinates_new()
	instead of duplicating a lot of code.  Fixes bug #161756.
	
	* gimp/app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: small change in 
	chainbutton handling to make above work.

2004-12-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc-frame.[ch]: made plug_in_proc_frame_free()
	a static function.

2004-12-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Item conversion depends on the old *and* the new item type, so
	it can't live in the old item's vtable only:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: split GimpItem::convert() into
	GimpItem::convert_from() (which is called on the old item and
	creates the new item) and GimpItem::convert_to() (which is called
	on the new item). This way functions from the old *and* new items'
	vtables are called and it's possible to convert between item types
	which live on different branches of the class hierarchy or to item
	types which live further down the class tree than the old item.

	(gimp_item_convert): call ::convert_to() on the new item created
	by ::convert_from().

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: changed ::convert() implementation
	to ::convert_from().

	* app/core/gimplayer.c: changed ::convert() to ::convert_to().
	Fixes bug #161877.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/asc2img.scm: removed this script as it
	is broken beyond repair and the functionality is provided by the
	text tool itself.

2004-12-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS: added NEWS for the stable branch (no, we haven't branched
	yet).

	* Makefile.am
	* NEWS.pre-2.2: moved old NEWS here.
	
2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (blur_line): fixed the degenerate case
	where the source image is smaller than the blurred area. This used
	to give artefacts at the borders.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup and micro
	optimizations.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: reverted the last change since it
	introduced artefacts. Even had to increase the border around the
	previewed area. Fixed a bug in unsharp_region() where it was using
	the wrong source region for blurring.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: compute preview for the displayed area
	only, some more code cleanup.

2004-12-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): fixed bug #157910.
	More code cleanup and some trivial optimizations.

2004-12-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	(gradient_editor_actions_update): if the dialog is insensitive,
	disable all actions which modify the gradient. Fixes bug #161411.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.c: update the UI manager
	after setting the dialog sensitive/insensitive so te above works.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: more code cleanup.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region):
	unset the dirty flag on the GimpPixelRgn used to iterate the region.

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c (gimp_pixel_rgn_init): improved docs.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: code cleanup, no real changes.

2004-12-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.2.1.

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: applied patch from
	Yeti that fixes a memory corruption (bug #161729).

2004-12-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2.0 release.
