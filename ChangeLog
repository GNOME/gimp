Thu May 28 01:16:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	message_box or prints to console depending on whether the
	no_interface is set or not. gimp-message is also exported
	to the PDB as a wrapper to g_message, and libgimp has a new
	API: gimp_message. libgimp also overrides g_message for all
	plugins. Converted lots of messages in app/* to g_message.

	the app/channels_dialog.c app/layers_dialog.c code for dealing

Wed Apr 15 02:03:25 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: disable keyboard accelerators
	during mouse image operations, so nothing funky happens

	or running a plugin)

Wed Apr 15 01:58:12 EDT 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: made a change to gdisplays_update_area to
	update _all_ gdisplays that point at the gimage ID.  This

	the prefs code.

Mon Apr 13 00:27:45 EDT 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/gdisplay.c: Set the current tool's gdisplay pointer to NULL
	when destroying a gdisplay

	* app/interface.c: Use "clicked" as the signal to handle for menu
	based tools.  This lets us pop by_color_select back up.

	* gimp_tips.txt: added a few more tips
	* plugins/webbrowser/webbrowser.scm: updated the URL to the

	recognize all types of tiff configs

	* app/gdisplay_ops.c: resize on zoom fix for naught window
	positioning from Kevin Cozens <kcozens@interlog.com>

	* app/errors.c: gdk_exit needs to be prototyped

	* added three new logo-scripts from keebler@wco.com:
	bovinated-logo.scm, comic-logo.scm and gradient-bevel-logo.scm

Thu Apr  9 09:28:04 1998  Scott Goehring  <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_main): strict C requires that function
	pointers be preceded by '&'.  SGI compilers seem to not like it
	when they're not.

	* app/gdisplay.c: fixed updating to not clip display updates to
	image boundary (so that layer boundaries that hang over will be
	erased properly when the layer is removed); fixes a long-standing

	command line that loads the files after gtk_main starts.  This
	fixes the segfault from the tips dialog when you load images on

	aren't used. Also #undef PACKAGE and VERSION since some
	jconfig.h's define it

	* updated included regex.[ch] to the one in GNU grep

	* plug-ins/script-fu/interp_regex.c: we don't need to kludge
	around OSF1 anymore, since we use our own regex stuff

Wed Apr  8 17:55:38 EDT 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	*plugins/script-fu/scripts/grid-system.scm
	*plugins/script-fu/scripts/hsv-graph.scm

	have proper regex functions on all platforms

	* updated gfig plugin

Mon Apr  6 20:38:49 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: fix for $srcdir != $builddir for data. Tightened
	check for random() and add -lucb on systems that need it. Fix for
	xdelta.h check. Find xemacs as well as emacs. Properly define
	settings for print plugin.

	* app/Makefile.am: ditch -DNDEBUG, since nothing uses it

	* plug-ins/flame/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/flame/cmap.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/flame/libifs.c: properly handle random() and friends

	you'll always have an active tool.

Sat Apr  4 15:43:28 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/ops_buttons.[c|h]
        * app/channels_dialog.c
        * app/layers_dialog.c: The sensitivity of the buttons wasn't set
	correctly when deleting an image.

Fri Apr  3 13:49:38 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus.c
	* app/gdisplay.c
	* app/commands.[c|h]: Added a "Add Alpha Channel" menu-entry to
	the Image-menu. Now it is possible to work on a single-layer image

	* app/ops_buttons.[c|h]
	* app/channels_dialog.c

Thu Apr  2 04:06:50 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c: Always ungrab the pointer on button release.
	This is a quick and dirty hack to try to nuke the pointer grab
	bug.

Thu Apr  2 01:49:34 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/transform_core.c: added a change to make a note of the
	current drawable in the button_release.  This prevents the tool
	from being restarted when the transform_core makes a floating
	selection.
	* app/tools.c: Initialize the current drawable to NULL if
	there is gdisp == NULL.

Thu Apr  2 23:52:54 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org

	* app/gimage.c
	* app/tools.c: Made changes to restart tools properly when
	the current drawable changes.

Thu Apr  2 20:09:06 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/channels_dialog.c: the impossibility of duplicating a
	non-auxillary channel is now reflected by the menu-sensitivity

Thu Apr  2 15:34:22 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* updated iwarp to the version on the registry and reapplied
	(hopefully) all portability-patches that were applied in between

	* app/levels.c
	* app/posterize.c
	* app/threshold.c
	* app/transform_core.c: modified to call the cancel callback
	instead of the ok callback when freed.  modified to save the
	last used drawable so that we might be able to check later
	and restart the tool if need be.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/gimage.c: modified tool restart/destruction code

	* app/tools.c
	* app/tools.h: added tools_initialize, made changes to
	be able save the last used drawable in the tool.

Wed Apr  1 23:14:42 MEST 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added checks for print-systems as suggested by
	Michael Sweet
	* plugins/print
	* plugins/sgi: updated to the version on the registry

	gdisplays and the tool caches image data.

Wed Apr 01 03:40:15 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/disp_callbacks.c:  If the current gdisp->ID does not match
	the ID of the gdisp_ptr in the active_tool, restart it.

Tue Mar 31 03:10:12 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: Set tool->preserve to TRUE in tools_new_iscissors.

Tue Mar 31 02:21:15 EST 1998 Matthew Wilson <msw@gimp.org>

	* app/gimage.c
	* app/tools.c
	* app/tools.h: Added a field in the Tools struct, preserve.
	During gimage_dirty, if this flag is not set the tool will be
	reset.  This is good for tools that keep a copy of the image
	in cache for local manipulation like transform_core.

	* app/bezier_select.c
	* app/blend.c
	* app/brightness_contrast.c
	* app/bucket_fill.c
	* app/color_balance.c
	* app/color_picker.c

	* app/rect_select.c
	* app/text_tool.c
	* app/transform_core.c: Set the preserve flag to the correct
	values in the new functions and wrapped calls to functions that
	dirty the gimage to prevent tool restarts.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c
	* app/menus.c: Removed Nether's tool patch.

Thu Mar 26 16:32:05 MST 1998 Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>
	* app/iscissors.c: fix a typo (i where a j should be)

Thu Mar 26 15:26:18 MST 1998 Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>
	* app/iscissors.c: This version works much better.
	outstanding bugs <VERY IMPORTANT>:

	1. the edgemap does not seem to be constructed quite right
	(construct_edge_map) -- uncomment #define
	ISCISSORS_STILL_DOES_NOT_WORK and take a look at the edgemap -- it
	will be saved to the file "dump"

	2. sigsegvs if the layer offset isn't 0,0.  dunno why.

	3. convert to bezier still does not work!  Any tools experts wanna
	help me with it?  (it converts to bezier fine, it just doesn't set
	the active tool to bezier currectly.)

Thu Mar 26 12:15:38 MST 1998 Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: fixes the display artifact where the preview
	outline of the selected area would not appear or would appear in the
	wrong place or have the wrong shape

Thu Mar 26 12:00:47 MST 1998 Nathan Summers <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/iscissors.c: This should hopefully fix most of the UMRs
	(uninitialized memory reads) found with Purify.  No noticable
	change in iscissors's behavior, unfortunately.

Thu Mar 26 13:03:18 EST 1998 Adrian Likins <adrian@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c app/brush_select.c app/brushes.c
	app/brushes.h app/convert.c app/gradient.c app/gradient.h
	app/palette.c app/palette.h app/pattern_select.c app/patterns.c
	app/patterns.h:   Fixed up --no-data so that the various *_init()
	routines always get called, and so that when in interactive mode
	the data can be loaded by the user even when started with --no-data.
	Fixes the blend bug too...

Thu Mar 26 18:38:54 MET 1998 Sven Neumann <sven@gimp.org>

	app/gradient.c: fixed another --no-data problem; also the
	editor now behaves better when it is resized

	* app/asupsample.c (adaptive_supersample_area): Removed Sopwith's
	"speed optimizations", as they introduced bugs (exposed by using a

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: Eliminated use of

	warnings about unused variables.

	* plug-ins/header.c: Raphael Quinet's patch to fix green channel
	and save reasonably-sized lines instead of a single enormous
	string.  Broken compilers barf on them.

	layers dialog if it is invoked when it was already shown.

	* app/commands.c (file_new_cmd_callback): Patch to not let the
	file/new dialog create indexed images.

	* app/tips_dialog.c (read_tips_file): Added fclose(fp).

	* app/gimprc.c (save_gimprc): Added g_free(cur_line).  It was

	* Fixed a *lot* of uninitialized variables in the app/ directory,

	was never being used.

	* app/disp_callbacks.c (gdisplay_canvas_events): Changed the type
	of tmask to be GdkModifierType.

	* app/brushes.c: Removed the declaration of int_value (it is never used).

	* app/gimprc.c app/gimprc.h app/commands.c app/tips_dialog.c:
 	save_gimprc() may modify the lists it gets passed (by
 	adding/removing elements).  Changed the prototype to take GList**
 	values instead of just GList*.  Changed the calls to save_gimprc()
	accordingly.

          since it is allocated in that function and no longer used

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory overrun in plug_in.c when
          nargs < current_return_nvals, in case the plug-in returns bad
          number of return values.

        * app/plug_in.c: destroy arguments when PDB lookup failed.

        * app/plug_in.c: fixed memory leak in plug_in_params_destroy()

	  see www.gimp.org/~adrian/scripts.html

	* patched maze.c to work better interactively

        * patched noisify.c to show more informative labels and to
          correct a bug with values of 0 for a channel still allowing
          some noise to be added.

        * changed some of the alien-glow-* scripts to have better defaults

        * moving script-fu wasnt entirely my idea :-)
