 * @scale_y: Amount to scale in y direction.
 * @angle: The angle of rotation (radians).
 * @dest_x: X coordinate of where the center goes.
 * @dest_y: Y coordinate of where the center goes.
 *
 * Transform the specified item in 2d.
 *
 * This procedure transforms the specified item.
 *
 * The transformation is done by scaling by the x and y scale factors
 * about the point (source_x, source_y), then rotating around the same
 * point, then translating that point to the new position (dest_x,
 * dest_y).
 *
 * If a selection exists and the item is a drawable, the portion of the
 * drawable which lies under the selection is cut from the drawable and
 * made into a floating selection which is then transformed as
 * specified. The return value is the ID of the transformed floating
 * selection.
 *
 * If there is no selection or the item is not a drawable, the entire
 * item will be transformed according to the specified parameters.
 * Additionally, if the item has its linked flag set to TRUE, all
 * additional items contained in the image which have the linked flag
 * set to TRUE will also be transformed the same way. The return value
 * will be equal to the item ID supplied as input.
 *
 * This procedure is affected by the following context setters:
 * gimp_context_set_interpolation(),
 * gimp_context_set_transform_direction(),
 * gimp_context_set_transform_resize().
 *
 * Returns: The transformed item.
