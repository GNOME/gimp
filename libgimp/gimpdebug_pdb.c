/**
 * gimp_debug_timer_start:

 * Starts measuring elapsed time.
 *
 * This procedure starts a timer, measuring the elapsed time since the
 * call. Each call to this procedure should be matched by a call to
 * gimp_debug_timer_end(), which returns the elapsed time.
 * If there is already an active timer, it is not affected by the call,
 * however, a matching gimp_debug_timer_end() call is still required.
 *
 * This is a debug utility procedure. It is subject to change at any
 * point, and should not be used in production.
 *
 * Returns: TRUE on success.
