/**
 * gimp_selection_float:
 * @image_ID: ignored
 * @drawable_ID: The drawable from which to float selection.
 * @offx: x offset for translation.
 * @offy: y offset for translation.
 *
 * Float the selection from the specified drawable with initial offsets
 * as specified.
 *
 * This procedure determines the region of the specified drawable that
 * lies beneath the current selection. The region is then cut from the
 * drawable and the resulting data is made into a new layer which is
 * instantiated as a floating selection. The offsets allow initial
 * positioning of the new floating selection.
 *
 * Returns: The floated layer.
