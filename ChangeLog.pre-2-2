2004-12-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c: free the dialog's private data
	struct using a weak reference, not in a "destroy" handler.  Should
	fix bug #161472.

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.c: same change here.

2004-12-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-12-17  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: Kill some nonsensical code that
	tried to set control points in a free form curve based on the
	image coordinates (huh?). Update the Graph after adding a point.
	Untabbified.

2004-12-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c (gimp_image_map_tool_pick_color):

2004-12-16  Sven Neumann  <neumann@jpk.com>

	* app/config/gimpconfig-dump.c (dump_gimprc_manpage): escape hyphens.

	* docs/gimp.1.in: documented the way that splash images are choosen.

	* docs/gimprc.5.in: regenerated.

2004-12-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_data_get_*): get gimp, display or
	image from a context only if it isn't NULL. Fixes warnings and
	crashes when dragging around some dockables (the dockables'
	context temporarily becomes NULL while dragging).

	Reordered checks for the passed "data" to be consistent across the
	various functions.

	Removed assertions which said "#warning: remove me before 2.2"

2004-12-16  Sven Neumann  <neumann@jpk.com>

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_keyboard_shortcuts_dialog):
	added a note on how to use the dialog, copied from the GNOME keyboard
	shortcuts editor.

2004-12-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: let gimp_text() and
	gimp_text_fontname() succeed but return -1 if no layer was created.
	Fixes bug #161272.

	* app/pdb/text_tool_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimptexttool_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-12-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.[ch]: added utility function
	gimp_drawable_preview_bytes() and use it. Some cleanup,
	untabified.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererdrawable.c: use
	gimp_drawable_preview_bytes() instead of duplicating its code.

2004-12-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>
	    Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_scale):
	fixed RGBA resampling by using premultiplied values for the
	intermediate accumulation buffer. Fixes bugs #72880 and #72881.

2004-12-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc-frame.[ch]: added "gint ref_count" to
	the PlugInProcFrame struct. Added new functions
	plug_in_proc_frame_ref/unref().

	(plug_in_proc_frame_new): set the ref_count to 1.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.[ch] (plug_in_proc_frame_push): return the
	new proc_frame.

	(plug_in_proc_frame_pop): use unref() instead of free().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c (plug_in_temp_run): ref the proc_frame
	while running its main loop. Removed the call to
	plug_in_proc_frame_pop().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_temp_proc_return):
	call plug_in_proc_frame_pop() immediately after
	plug_in_main_loop_quit() so the proc_frame goes away from the
	stack and can't be used accidentially if the core is too busy to
	return to the main loop before the next command arrives on the
	wire. Really fixes bug #161114 this time.

2004-12-14  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpstroke.[ch]: Changed the "gradient" parameter
	to "slope" to make it more clear what the returned result is (which
	was wrong earlier).
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: changed accordingly

	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimppaths_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	Fixes bug #161274.

2004-12-14  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c: don't use 
	gtk_tree_selection_get_selected with GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE. Should
	finally fix bug #149157.

2004-12-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.c (gimp_stock_init): documented.

2004-12-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_misc.c (make_toolbar_radio_icon): don't
	call gtk_radio_tool_button_new_with_stock_from_widget() with a
	NULL widget. Fixes bug #161210.

2004-12-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: added GIMP_API_VERSION to the generated gimpversion.h.

	* libgimpbase/gimpenv.c (gimp_toplevel_directory): use
	GIMP_API_VERSION instead of GIMP_MACRO_VERSION.GIMP_MINOR_VERSION
	when building a path to test the plug-in executable path against.

2004-12-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: added gimp_drawable_sub_thumbnail()
	to enable plug-ins avoiding #142074-alike bugs if they need to.

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppixbuf.[ch]: wrap it with the same convenience
	APIs as gimp_drawable_thumbnail().

	* libgimp/gimp.def
	* libgimp/gimpui.def: changed accordingly.

2004-12-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING
	* autogen.sh
	* configure.in: switched to using gtkdocize for the build of the
	API docs.

2004-12-13  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c: don't try do to anything when
	selection is empty. Fixes bug #149157.

2004-12-13  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_misc.[ch]
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.[ch]
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_toolbar.[ch]
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_tools.[ch]: removed need for 
	GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED. Looking at #149157 next...

2004-12-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: don't show the Crop tool window if
	Shift is being pressed on the initial button_press event.

2004-12-13  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpfu.py: display PF_RADIO options vertically
	instead of horizontally, as suggested by Joao S. O. Bueno Calligaris.
	Fixes bug #160546.
	
2004-12-13  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: make the "gfig" layer parasites persistent,
	so that they will be saved in xcf files.  Stop printing "GFig
	parasite found" message.
	
2004-12-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppdbdialog.[ch]: don't forget the context we
	were created with but rmember it as pdb_dialog->caller_context.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrushselect.c
	* app/widgets/gimpfontselect.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradientselect.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteselect.c
	* app/widgets/gimppatternselect.c: use the caller_context when
	calling the temp_proc so the temp_proc's stack frame doesn't
	contain the dialog's private context (which is just a scratch
	model for the container views) but the plug-in's real context
	which is fully initialized. Fixes bug #161114.

2004-12-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablecombobox.c: fixed gtk-doc comment.

2004-12-13  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: let objects keep their own fill_style
	context.

2004-12-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c: applied patch from Adam D. Moss with
	more fixed dither improvements (bug #161123).

2004-12-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/splash.c: restrict splash image to screen size to guard us
	from insanely large splash images.

2004-12-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c (gimp_dock_delete_event): invert logic so
	everything except GTK_RESPONSE_OK keeps the dock open
	(e.g. hitting escape).

2004-12-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.c (gimp_drawable_get_sub_preview):
	added precondition check for the coords of the src area. Some
	cleanup and simplification.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererdrawable.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_drawable_render): don't request sub-previews
	of area outside the drawable and don't reuqest previews of zero
	width or height. Fixes crashes with the new preview code.

2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Applied patch from Adam D. Moss (bug #161113):
	
	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c: Use a slower but much nicer
	technique for finding the two best colours to dither between when
	using fixed/positional dither methods.  Makes positional dither
	much less lame.

2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c (film): push a context around code that
	changes the foreground color.

2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/batch.c (batch_run): changed handling of the 'gimp -b -'
	command-line. It used to spawn three instances of Script-Fu, two
	should be more than enough.

2004-12-12  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimpdataeditor.c: make Revert button insensitive
	because revert is not yet implemented (bug #152259).
	
2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c: show a confirmation dialog if a dock
	with multiple tabs is being closed. Sorry for the new strings,
	they were carefully copied from gnome-terminal.

2004-12-12  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/pnm.c: make export do the right thing when
	saving as .pgm or .ppm.  Fixes bug #160045.
	
2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added gimp_edit_copy_visible.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: deprecated.

2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c: applied patch from Brion Vibber
	that adds an alpha channel to the pasted layer. Fixes bug #148601.

2004-12-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-manager-crop.c: removed trailing whitespace.

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c: need to define
	GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED for gtk_toolbar_append_space().

2004-12-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch]: added new function
	copy_region_nocow() as a workaround for the fact that sharing
	tiles with the projection is heavily broken.

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_invalidate): added a warning when
	entering the code path that breaks badly.

	* app/core/gimp-edit.[ch]: added gimp_edit_copy_visible(), using
	the non-COW copying function above.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added GIMP_HELP_COPY_VISIBLE.

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c
	* app/actions/edit-commands.[ch]: added action & callback for
	"edit-copy-visible".

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added "edit-copy-visible" to the image
	menu.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb: added gimp_edit_copy_visible()
	PDB wrapper.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpedit_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: removed all code
	and made it a backward compat wrapper around gimp-edit-copy-visible.
	Fixes bug #138662.

2004-12-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_private):
	implement it using gimp_drawable_get_sub_preview(). Removes
	massive code duplication introduced by yesterday's fix.

2004-12-11  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: Apply the layer mask
	when copying a single layer with a layer mask. Fixes bug #138662.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/t-o-p-logo.scm: Removed ' character.

2004-12-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS
	* README: updates for the GIMP 2.2.0 release.

2004-12-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: got rid of a global variable.

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c (dialog_bumpmap_callback): more changes
	to restore the gimp-2.0 behaviour.

2004-12-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_drawable_get_sub_preview() which returns a scaled preview of
	a part of a drawable.

	(gimp_drawable_preview_scale): made it work with srcPR.x and
	srcPR.y being != 0.

	* app/core/gimpimage-preview.c (gimp_image_get_new_preview)
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererdrawable.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_drawable_render): if the area of the drawable
	preview is more than 4 times larger than the drawable itself (evil
	heuristic, but seems to work fine), use above function to get a
	sub-preview of the drawable instead of getting an insanely large
	preview of the whole drawable just to use a small part of it.
	Fixes bug #142074.

	* app/core/gimpimage-preview.c (gimp_image_get_new_preview):
	optimized by skipping layers which do not intersect with the
	canvas.

2004-12-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c (dialog_bumpmap_callback): do actually
	change the bumpmap drawable. Fixes bug #160985, hopefully without
	reopening bug #158494.

2004-12-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: set version to 2.2.0.

	* tools/Makefile.am
	* tools/authorsgen/Makefile.am
	* tools/authorsgen/authorsgen.pl
	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: removed authorsgen, a perl script
	that used to be used to create AUTHORS and authors.h.

	* Makefile.am
	* authors.dtd
	* authors.xml: added a simple XML file that lists authors and
	contributors and a DTD to validate it.

	* authors.xsl: a stylesheet to generate AUTHORS from authors.xml.

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/authors.xsl: a stylesheet to generate authors.h from
	authors.xml.

	* app/dialogs/authors.h: regenerated.

	* app/dialogs/about-dialog.c: added a const modifier.

2004-12-09  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: make histogram editor,
	and therefore histogram dialog, use the selection.  Should
	resolve bug #72959.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-histogram.h: remove trailing whitespace.
	
2004-12-10  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdatafactoryview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: #include <string.h> for strcmp()

2004-12-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdatafactoryview.c
	(gimp_data_factory_view_tree_name_edited)
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	(gimp_item_tree_view_name_edited)
	* app/widgets/gimptemplateview.c
	(gimp_template_view_tree_name_edited): call gimp_object_set_name()
	or gimp_item_rename() only if the item's name has actually changed
	and restore the old text otherwise. Fixes one instance of "name is
	not updated correctly after editing" for which I blamed GTK+ in
	bug #145463 :-) The other instances should be fixed in GTK+ HEAD
	and are imho unfixable with GTK+ 2.4.

2004-12-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_clear_items): clear all viewable cell
	renderers so they don't keep pointers to layers/masks which don't
	exist any more. Fixes the additional problem in bug #148852 but
	not the bug itself.

2004-12-09  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/core/gimpbrushpipe.c (gimp_brush_pipe_select_brush):
	Don't initialize a new random number generator every time a brush
	is selected from a pipe.  Fixes bug #148205).
	
2004-12-09  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c: marked the menu entry for translation
	(reported by Zigomar)

2004-12-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: set a focus_chain on the size_entries
	so the focus order is width->height->chain->unitmenu and not
	width->chain->height->unitmenu.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: changed focus_chain code to
	work like above (cosmetics).

2004-12-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/splash.c (splash_update): only expose the area of the
	window that actually changed.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-rc.c (plug_in_rc_write): changed the header
	and footer to be more in line with the other rc files.

2004-12-08  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c (print_size_dialog_size_changed):
	Previous fix only worked if units were inches -- now seems to
	work for all units. (fixes #159273 ?)

2004-12-08  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/randomize.c:  Changed algorithm for Pick and
	Slur to treat all channels within a pixel in the same way;
	intended to fix bug #72852.
	
2004-12-08  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c (print_size_dialog_size_changed):
	fixed kludgy use of size entry, seems to fix bug #159273.

2004-12-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: renamed
	gimp_ui_manager_get_action() to gimp_ui_manager_find_action().

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: changed accordingly.

	(this change is quite useless as it stands, but will help keeping
	the diff between 2.2 and 2.3 small as soon as we're branched).

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	(gimp_colormap_preview_button_press): invoke the "edit-color", not
	"new-color" action upon double click.

	(palette_editor_select_entry): update the ui manager after
	selecting the entry so the entry-specific actions become sensitive
	if there was no entry selected before.

2004-12-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.[ch]: added new prop_widget
	gimp_prop_int_combo_box_new() which takes a pre-built GimpIntStore
	and allows to create views on int properties with arbitrary sets
	of values (not just enums).

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollereditor.c
	(gimp_controller_editor_constructor): added support for generic
	combo boxes controlled exclusively by controller properties: if an
	int property "foo" is followed by an object property "foo-values"
	and the contained object is a GimpIntStore, use that store as
	model for selecting "foo"'s values using
	gimp_prop_int_combo_box_new().

	(Allows for more flexible controller configuration, the actual use
	case in the midi controller is still work in progress).

2004-12-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: removed duplicate entry for Roman.

	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: added Róman Joost to
	contributors

2004-12-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: applied patch from Sven Neumann
	which removes code that prevents layers with mask from being
	transformed.

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: added "gboolean mask_empty"
	parameter to GimpTransformTool::transform(). Needed because the
	selection gets cleared by cutting from the drawable and we need
	the selection's state before that cutting.

	(gimp_transform_tool_doit): pass "mask_empty" to
	GimpTransformTool::transform():

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c (gimp_transform_tool_real_transform)
	* app/tools/gimpfliptool.c (gimp_flip_tool_transform): when
	transforming a layer with mask and there is no selection,
	transform the mask just as if it was a linked item.
	Fixes bug #143837 and bug #159697.

2004-12-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-transform-utils.c (gimp_transform_matrix_flip_free):
	applied patch from Joao S. O. Bueno that fixes bug #160339.

2004-12-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/help/domain.c
	* plug-ins/help/gimp-help-lookup.c
	* plug-ins/help/help.[ch]: if the help files are not installed,
	uninstall the temporary procedure and quit. Fixes bug #160258.

2004-12-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/lic.c: applied patch from Joao S. O. Bueno that
	sets a lower limit for the filter length (bug #160121). The patch
	also makes the plug-in work on drawables with alpha channel.

2004-12-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: applied patch from Karine Proot that
	limits the size of the preview in the WMF loader (bug #133521).

2004-12-04  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	function.

2004-12-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer): when removing
	the floating selection, call gimp_drawable_invalidate_boundary()
	*before* setting gimage->floating_sel to NULL because otherwise
	gimp_display_shell_selection_invis() won't clear the correct
	selection bounds and leave garbage on screen. Fixes bug #160247.

2004-12-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/tool-options-actions.c
	(tool_options_actions_update_presets): don't forget to initialize
	the "value_variable" boolean of GimpEnumActionEntry. Fixes myriads
	of warnings about wrong values for boolean properties.

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions_setup): same
	here. Fixes nothing but is cleaner.

2004-12-02  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: Fixed stupid typo that caused
	distorted vectors on scaling after resizing. Spotted by
	Joao S. O. Bueno.

	Fixes bug #157852.

2004-12-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: rephrased the warning that is shown when the
	intltool check fails.

2004-12-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.c (gimp_ui_manager_ui_get): improved
	error message about missing XML files.

2004-12-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c
	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c: check if gimp_ui_manager_ui_get()
	actually returns something. Prevents crashes caused by missing
	ui manager xml files. Fixes bug #159346.

2004-12-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptoolview.c (gimp_tool_view_select_item): no need
	to update the ui manager here, the parent class already does it.

2004-11-30  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/README: removed some very obsolete stuff.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-arc.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-arc.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-circle.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-circle.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c: small cleanups

2004-11-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/themes.c (themes_init): use gtk_rc_parse() instead of
	gtk_rc_add_default_file() to add ~/.gimp-2.2/themerc to the list
	of files parsed by GTK+ because the latter works only before
	gtk_init(). Fixes bug #155963.

2004-11-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c: reordered prototypes to match
	order of implementations.

2004-11-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/sanity.c: we check for the same version of freetype on all
	platforms, no need for an ifdef here.

2004-11-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpexport.c: some more HIG-ification tweaks to the
	Export dialogs.

2004-11-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c
	(gimp_action_group_set_action_color)
	(gimp_action_group_set_action_color): allow to set color and
	viewable to NULL, GimpAction handles this nicely. Fixes warnings
	some foo_actions_update() functions were triggering.

2004-11-30  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/*[ch]: code cleanup

2004-11-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/display.pdb: make it work as documented (fail
	if the new_image already has a display). Also fail if the
	old_image doesn't have any display (changed docs accordingly).
	On success, take over the initial reference count of the new
	image, just as the gimp_display_new() PDB wrapper does.
	Fixes bug #159051.

	* app/pdb/display_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdisplay_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-11-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-save.c (file_save_as): when the image filename
	changes, forget the filename that was last used with "save-a-copy".

2004-11-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_toggle_callback):
	change the "update" property and notify listeners (in particular
	GimpDrawablePreview) before invalidating the preview. Plug-ins
	might (needlessly) look at the property to decide whether they
	need to redraw. Fixes bug #159816.

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): no need to look at
	the value of the "Preview" toggle. GimpPreview takes care this.

2004-11-29  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: issue a repaint after the
	"show previous", "show next" and "show all" callbacks.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: fixed some comments.

2004-11-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preview.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c: undeprecated.

2004-11-28  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c: copy the style of the object when
	pushing it to the undo stack, so undoing works as expected.

2004-11-28  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.h: create a new function to get the current
	style instead of using a global pointer for this
	(gfig_context_get_current_style ())

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-circle.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: use this function everywhere it is needed. And
	remove the current_style field from GfigContext.

	(unrelated):
	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.h
	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/FractalExplorer.c: small cleanups

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: removed unused stack of styles. Removed
	gimp_style from GFigContext.

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c (run): push a context for GFig.

2004-11-28  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c: renamed undo_water_mark to undo_level.
	Fixed the style handling when clearing the whole thing and undoing in
	some very particular cases. The undo part should certainly be redone
	to some extent.

	Btw, this is the revision 1.10000 of the ChangeLog, yeah!

2004-11-28  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: make sure PaintType is saved and
	loaded with the style.
	
2004-11-28  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: correctly initializes the paint_type
	field of the default style.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: don't print an useless error message
	where no-one can see it when loading an other with no style but use
	the default style instead.

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.[ch]
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c: moved Undo and Clear to the Edit
	menu.  Added a utility function to set the sensitivity of an action
	by name. Cleaned up action callbacks.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: minor cleanup.

2004-11-28  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-arc.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-circle.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-ellipse.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-line.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-poly.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-spiral.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-star.c: made the class name uppercase since it is
	used to parse a gfig file.

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: make sure that widgets in the Grid
	and Preferences dialogs are only accessed while the dialogs exist.

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: made the Grid and Preferences
	dialogs singletons and declared them as transient to the GFig
	window. Don't let them run their own main loop.

2004-11-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: added a Close menu item to the
	menubar. Removed help buttons from popup dialogs. Set the same
	default directory in load and save filechoosers.

2004-11-27  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: escape utf8 as hex, to
	avoid perl trying to be so smart that it's stupid.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-11-27  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (save_image): thumbnail buffer variable
	declarations should be guarded under HAVE_EXIF.

2004-11-27  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/colorxhtml.py: s/colorhtml/colorxhtml/,
	so it doesn't clash with the perl version.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/Makefile.am: reflect filename change.

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: delay the creation of the display for
	the export image preview until the user requests a preview. Fixes
	bug #159376.

2004-11-27  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpexport.c: minor layout adjustments for HIG compliance.

2004-11-27  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/spyrogimp.scm: Force number of teeth
	to be integer values. Changed default for Outer teeth to give a
	more interesting image. Detabified file. Fixes bug #158448. 

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_script_proc):
	don't look at the menu path to determine if the script is
	image-based. Instead look at the number of parameters we are being
	called with.

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpinkoptions-gui.c: made the Size scale logarithmic
	as suggested in bug #159632.

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c (save_image): tell the user that we can't
	handle indexed images with alpha channel (bug #159600).

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c
	* app/widgets/gimpenumstore.h
	* app/widgets/gimpunitstore.c
	* plug-ins/common/retinex.c: applied patch by Tim Mooney that
	removes extraneous ;

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c (run): applied patch by Tim Mooney that
	increase the size of values[] to accomodate the use of
	file_wmf_load_thumb (bug #159601).

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: minor change to the PDB docs.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: regenerated.

2004-11-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.c
	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch]: moved code around.

2004-11-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: make sure the preview image type matches
	the source image type.

2004-11-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.c: don't fiddle with the source image,
	a save plug-in should save, nothing else.

	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch]: handle all sorts of image types.
	Fixes bug #157803.

2004-11-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: fixed docs for
	gimp_drawable_type_with_alpha().

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-11-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch] (ico_image_get_reduced_buf)
	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.c
	* plug-ins/winicon/icoload.c
	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.c: fixed drawable handling. This
	plug-in is still a complete mess and needs a lot more work.

2004-11-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c (gimp_paint_options_gui): only
	show the Incremental toggle for tools that use it (bug #159306).

2004-11-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdocumentlist.c (gimp_document_list_deserialize):
	don't add documents w/o a name to the list. Fixes bug #159510.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_resize): extended the
	check to take the offsets into account as well.

2004-11-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: Add the temporary layers to the image, so
	things work. Fixes bug #158895.

	* plug-ins/common/iwarp.c: Fix same naughtiness as above. There's
	other naughtiness still though.

	* plug-ins/common/sunras.c: use gboolean for byte2bit invert argument.

2004-11-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Use a jpeg_error_mgr that lives within
	PreviewPersistent, instead of an automatic variable in save_image.
	Fixes bug #159076.

2004-11-25  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: Add some sample code to retrieve
	the name of the connected MIDI device (ALSA).
	Do not set the "name" when connected to Alsa, since snd_seq_name()
	returns an uninteresting name.

2004-11-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_display_changed): if the active display
	becomes NULL (e.g. by closing a view), don't leave the user
	context with an image but no display. Instead, try to find another
	display of the same image and if that fails set the image to NULL.

	Prevents the various foo_actions_update() functions from being
	called with a NULL display while there is still an active image in
	the context.

	Fixes bug #159304.

	(Removed #warning about being misplaced from that function because
	it's a typical piece of ugly glue code that belongs exactly here).

2004-11-24  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: Accept >= 0 return values of the
	ioctl() to figure out the device name. Apparently it is the number of
	bytes written to the string, so we might omit the strlen() following,
	but I don't like to rely on that...

2004-11-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: guarded the whole header
	with GIMP_ENABLE_CONTROLLER_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION because it's no
	fixed API yet. Added a "state" property bacause "name" was abused
	as the controller's state. Added "help_domain" to the controller
	class.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h: don't include gimpcontroller.h

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* modules/controller_midi.c: set the "name" property to the name
	retrieved from the device, or to a default string if no name is
	available. Store the status in the "state" property. Added and
	changed some strings, but it's better to have the controller
	strings untranslated than to have no tooltips at all or misleading
	labels.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerkeyboard.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c: set default strings for both.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollereditor.c: added a GUI for the "state"
	property.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerkeyboard.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: #define
	GIMP_ENABLE_CONTROLLER_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION (just as in all files
	above).

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added the IDs of all controller
	modules and also of all other modules. The defines are not
	actually used, but this file is the canonical place to collect all
	the core's help IDs.

2004-11-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-templates.[ch]
	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c: merge the migrated user
	templaterc with the system templaterc so the users who have used
	gimp-2.0 before get our changes to the default templates.

2004-11-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_toggle_button_set_visible() which can be used as "toggled"
	callback on a GtkToggleButton and sets a widget (in)visible
	according to the toggle's "active" state.

	* app/tools/gimpblendoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimpselectionoptions.c: use it to hide (rather than
	just insensitize) the seldomly used "Feather edges", "Autoshrink
	selection", "Adaptive supersampling", "Fade out" and "Use color
	from gradient" widgets when their enabling toggle is unchecked.
	Makes the affected tool options much less crowded and noisy in
	their default appearance. Fixes bug #159008.

2004-11-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_add_proc): create
	dynamic sub-menus using a separate, ui-manager-global merge_id
	instead of the procedure's merge_id. Has the effect that the ui
	manager keeps around these sub-menus forever, even if the
	procedure that initially registered them is unregistered.
	Fixes menu ordering after Script-Fu->Refresh.

2004-11-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpparasitelist.c: cosmetics, untabified.

	* libgimpbase/gimpparasiteio.[ch]: added g_return_if_fail()'s
	to all functions. 

	(gimp_pixpipe_params_parse): changed "gchar*" param to "const
	gchar*" (sortof API change, but these files are most probably only
	used by GIMP itself). Still uses strtok() on the internal copy,
	but at least not on the passed string.

	* plug-ins/common/csource.c
	* plug-ins/common/gif.c
	* plug-ins/common/gih.c
	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c
	* plug-ins/common/png.c
	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c: use parasite getters instead of
	accessing the scruct members directly. Always use g_strndup()
	instead of just g_strdup() to get strings stored in parasites
	because there is no guarantee that they are nul-terminated.

2004-11-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_file.c (do_file_save_as_dialog): do
	actually use a save dialog here. Fixes bug #159194.

2004-11-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_resize): do nothing if
	the size doesn't change. This keeps text layers from being
	modified when an image is cropped and the layer is entirely inside
	the cropped area.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: put the Quit item back for now. We
	should think about this again in the next development cycle.

2004-11-22  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: Fixed incorrect
	comparison in if statement. Partial(?) fix for bug #138662. 

2004-11-22  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/pygimp/pygimp-logo.png: New pygimp logo, by Carol Spears.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpfu.py: Use new external logo file, some layout
	tweaks.

2004-11-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c (gimp_controller_info_init):
	always create the event mapping table. Fixes tons of warnings and
	non-functional controller mapping dialog when an empty controller
	was deserialized from controllerrc. Spotted by drc.

2004-11-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_exit_after_callback): call base_exit()
	before quitting the application using exit(). Fixes bug #159019.

	* app/base/tile-swap.c: moved the warning about a non-empty swap
	file into #ifdef GIMP_UNSTABLE ... #endif.

2004-11-22  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: correctly initialize the Antialising
	check box.  Reported by Zigomar.

2004-11-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: sort the SFMenu structs
	by their menu_paths *and* the procedure's menu_labels. Fixes menu
	item sorting after "Refresh".

2004-11-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.[ch] (gimp_text_options_editor_new):
	added a "menu_factory" parameter instead of trying to get it from
	the toplevel GimpDock (which does not exists if the tool options
	dialog does not exist). Fixes bug #159071.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_editor): pass the
	menu_factory.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c (dialogs_init): pass the global menu
	factory also when constructing the "toplevel" dialog factory so
	the above works.

2004-11-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.c (gimp_any_to_utf8): use g_strndup()
	instead of g_strdup() if a length was passed.

	* app/dialogs/info-window.c: g_strndup() the comment parasite's
	data and pass -1 as length to gimp_any_to_utf8() so we don't
	encounter the questionable (buggy?) behavior of g_utf8_validate()
	to fail upon finding '\0' within the "length" passed.
	Fixes bug #159051.

2004-11-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/struc.c: applied patch from Wolfgang Hofer
	which makes the plug-in use its procedure name for
	storing the "last_vals" struct. Fixes bug #159028.

	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c: ditto. Fixes bug #159029.

2004-11-22  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-line.c: fixed a stupid bug which made all lines
	half-selected.

2004-11-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/file-open-location-dialog.c: changed border-size of
	GimpContainerEntry to 0.

2004-11-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c: added --no-splash command-line option that
	is passed to gimp. Addresses Debian bug report #277989.

	* docs/gimp-remote.1.in: document the new option.

2004-11-21  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: reverted previous change, as not all the lv.pos are
	in CVS yet.

2004-11-21  Peteris Krisjanis  <pecisk@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added Latvian (lv) language support to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-11-21  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/erase-rows.scm: Applied patch from BM
	which makes the script work layers that have their top-left corner
	at a position other than the top-left corner of the image.
	Fixes bug #158863.

2004-11-21  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-arc.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-circle.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-ellipse.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-line.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-poly.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-spiral.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-star.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: makes which object is selected more obvious by
	using filled handles for the selected object.  Not perfect, but
	certainly a good hint.

2004-11-21  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c: call gfig_grid_colours() in the
	realize callback of the preview, so the gray gc of the grid works
	again. Reported by Zigomar.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-spiral.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-star.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/notes.txt: small cosmetics fixes.

2004-11-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: transfer the image resolution to
	newly created images.

2004-11-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/Brushes/snow1.pgm: reverted a change
	that Hans Breuer committed here, probably accidentally.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: reverted Hans's changes. There
	is indeed a Script-Fu server on Win32.

2004-11-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: removed "Quit" from the image menu.

2004-09-21  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* app/dialogs/makefile.msc : [new file]
	  app/dialogs/Makefile.am : added to EXTRA_DIST

	* **/makefile.msc app/gimpcore.def : updated

	* app/gimp.rc : let wilber be first

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c : msvc6 can't cast uint64 either

	* libgimpbase/gimpwin32-io.h : make up recent loss of ftruncate in GLib

	* libgimpthumbnail/gimpthumbnail.c : <process.h> for getpid() on win32

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c : include gimpwin32-io.h

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siodwrapper.c plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c :
	there is no script-fu-server on win32

2004-11-21  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/addborder.scm: first resize the
	image, then add the border layer and then fill it

2004-11-20  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: Need to call gettext in
	script-fu_menu_compare. Spotted by Sven. Removed obsolete #define's.

2004-11-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: renamed variable
	"script_list" to "script_tree" because it's a GTree.

	(script_fu_remove_script): g_list_free() the right list (don't
	leak all lists of scripts at the tree leaves).

2004-11-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2-pre2 release.

2004-11-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: added an (optional) parameter that
	allows to request the output in the filesystem encoding.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_menu_compare):
	compare the menu paths, not the struct pointers.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: added a naive glob() implementation
	which handles the most common use case and is certainly better
	than nothing. Closes bug #143661 again.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c: converted a g_warning() to g_printerr().

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/xpm.c: just some minor code cleanup.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: combined two "Stroke" labels into a
	single one.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c: applied a (modified) patch that adds
	the possibility to correlate the noise with the signal. Adds the
	new PDB procedure "plug_in_scatter_rgb". Fixes bug #158700.

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c: set a reasonable default size.

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c (skip_ps) (ps_close): fixed use of
	fread(). Unfortunately this slowed down the plug-in again.
	Disabled the code that reads the pipe to the end. This brings it
	back to speed. Seems to work fine for me, let's see if this causes
	problems for anyone...

2004-11-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: moved into the
	<Image>/Select/Modify menu now that we can safely use placeholders
	from Script-Fu.

2004-11-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/stddefs.pdb: added support for deprecated procedures
	without any replacement.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_run): added
	a special warning for procedures without replacement.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: deprecated drawable_set_image()
	without any replacement and made it a nop (which fails if the
	passed image is different from the drawable's image). It's not
	needed any longer since 2.0 and moreover dangerous to use.

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* app/core/gimpitem.c (gimp_item_set_image): replaced assertion
	for gimp_item_is_floating() by !gimp_item_is_attached(). The
	former warned when adding a layer with already added mask to the
	image (which is a perfectly valid operation).

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: added a thumbnail load procedure
	(bug #158193).

2004-11-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Script-Fu string cleanup/simplification: apply the same fix for
	menu path translation that was done for plug-ins a while ago.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c (script_fu_auxillary_init): use
	gimp_plugin_menu_register() on the "Refresh" temp_proc.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/*.scm: ported all scripts to use
	script-fu-menu-register and pass just the menu label in
	script-fu-register. Cleaned up all register calls to share a
	somewhat similar formatting.

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c: changed the default to load only
	the first page of the document and added a tooltip describing how
	to specify what pages to get.

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-open.c (file_open_thumbnail): fixed check for
	number of return values.

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c: speed up loading of multi-page
	documents significantly by skipping in large chunks instead of using
	fgetc() to crawl through the stream.

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-open.c (file_open_thumbnail): check the number of
	return values. Only retrieve width and height if the thumbnail
	load procedure does actually provide this information.

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c: added a procedure to load a
	thumbnail.  For now it only renders the first page of the
	document at low resolution. It should be extended to load an
	embedded thumbnail if one is available.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c
	* plug-ins/common/svg.c: no need to register a menu label for the
	thumbnail loaders. Allocate the return_vals array large enough to
	hold all return values.

2004-11-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpenumaction.[ch]: added boolean property
	"value-variable" which specifies if the GimpEnumAction::selected()
	signal may be emitted with arbirtary values (value-variable = TRUE)
	or *only* with enum_action->value (value-variable = FALSE).

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added "gboolean
	value_variable" to GimpEnumActionEntry and set it in
	gimp_action_group_add_enum_actions().

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/drawable-actions.c
	* app/actions/edit-actions.c
	* app/actions/error-console-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/palette-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-actions.c: set "variable" to FALSE for all enum
	actions except those which are used with the GIMP_ACTION_SELECT_SET
	voodoo.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c (gimp_controllers_event_mapped):
	fall back to gtk_action_activate() if the action specified in a
	GIMP_CONTROLLER_EVENT_VALUE mapping is not variable. Enables
	triggering of enum actions from GIMP_CONTROLLER_EVENT_VALUE events
	(like midi note-on and note-off).

2004-11-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4: pasted the complete alsa.m4 so compiling from
	CVS doesn't require alsa.m4 to be installed.

	* configure.in: check for alsa >= 1.0.0 and define HAVE_ALSA
	if found.

	* modules/Makefile.am: build controller_midi with ALSA_CFLAGS
	and ALSA_LIBS.

	* modules/controller_midi.c: s/HAVE_ALSALIB_H/HAVE_ALSA/.

2004-11-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/compressor.c (compressors): added back the
	.xcf.gz and .xcf.bz2 extensions because they are the only way
	to figure the special nature of this plug-in's extensions.

	* app/widgets/gimpfileprocview.[ch]: keep a list of "meta
	extensions" (extensions which have a '.' themselves).

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_proc_changed):
	try to replace the whole extension if the last extension is one of
	the meta extensions kept by GimpFileProcView. Fixes bug #158377.

2004-11-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.[ch]
	* plug-ins/maze/maze_face.c: removed the extra help button from
	the Maze plug-in. Fixes bug #158605.

2004-11-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	The following fixes have no visible effect because nobody
	uses gimp_plugin_menu_register() on temp_procs yet:

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.[ch]: added
	plug_in_actions_add_path() which just adds the actions needed for
	a given menu math, but not the procedure action itself.

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_menus_create_entry): create the
	menu_path's actions using above function so adding of submenus to
	existing ui managers works.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugin_menu_register_invoker):
	don't add a menu if "no_interface" is TRUE.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: pass untranslated
	menu_paths to the core, not translated ones. Don't store the
	scripts directly in the "script_list" tree but use a list of
	scripts per key because there can be identical keys for different
	scripts now. Fixed sorting of menu entries and menus.

2004-11-18  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c: implemented support for ALSA-midi,
	currently disabled. Needs a configure-check and proper linking
	against libasound.

2004-11-17  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: Fixed initialisation issue
	that was crashing the plug-in on repeat runs. Fixes bug
	#158494.

2004-11-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c: added missing callbacks for the
	size entries. Needs some more work though...

2004-11-17  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/Makefile.am: make libgimpprocbrowser a libtooled
	library.

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbrowser.[ch]: add a user_data pointer
	for GimpProcBrowserApplyCallback.

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbrowser.c: only convert the name to
	scheme style if scheme_names in the proc info pane too.

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/procedure-browser.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c: pass NULL as user_data.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/Makefile.am: reference libgimpprocbrowser.la.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/pygimp/procbrowser.c: new module, which wraps
	libgimprocbrowser.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpmodule.c
	* plug-ins/pygimp/pygimp.h
	* plug-ins/pygimp/pygimp-pdb.c: export GimpPDBFunction so other
	modules can use it.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/pdbbrowse.py
	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/gimpcons.py: use gimpprocbrowser.

2004-11-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c: added a utility
	function to reduce code duplication.

2004-11-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.[ch]
	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: appled patch from Kevin
	Cozens which adds (script-fu-menu-register) and allows scripts to
	register their menu_paths the same undeprecated way as plug-ins.
	Fixes bug #158117.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/test-sphere.scm: example how to use
	the new API. Doesn't change strings because test-shpere.scm is an
	untranslated example script.

2004-11-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made plug-in menu registration work the same way for ordinary and
	temporary procedures. Addresses bug #158117.

	* app/core/gimp-gui.[ch]: added "const gchar *menu_path" to
	gimp_menus_create_entry().

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_menus_create_entry): if menu_path is
	NULL, behave as before and create an action and its menu entries
	for all the procedure's menu_paths. If it is non-NULL, skip action
	creation and create a menu entry just for that path.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c (plug_ins_temp_proc_def_add): call
	gimp_menus_create_entry() with a NULL menu path and call it if
	proc_def->menu_paths *or* proc_def->menu_label is non-NULL, so
	it creates at least the procedure's action, even if it has
	no menu_path (yet).

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugin_menu_register): check both
	the list of procs and temp_procs when trying to register the
	entry.  Allow ordinary procedures and extensions to install stuff
	at query() and init() time and allow temp_procs to install stuff
	at any time.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-11-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbox.c
	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbrowser.[ch]
	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocview.c: some cleanup in preparation
	of moving it to a more public place.

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/procedure-browser.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c: changed accordingly.

2004-11-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am (DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS): removed --enable-gtk-doc
	here since it only causes 'make distcheck' to break earlier as usual.

2004-11-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/rcm/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_callback.c
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_dialog.c
	* plug-ins/rcm/rcm_stock.[ch]: applied a patch from Karine Proot
	that replaces the XPM icons with stock icons (bug #140202).

	* plug-ins/rcm/pixmaps/*.xpm: removed.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_stock.c
	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_stock.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-stock.c: fixed a common but harmless mistake
	in the icon factory code.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: Hide SVG drop g_print under
	be_verbose.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpui.py: Handle placeholder defaults for gimp
	objects (bug #158392). Patch by Joao S. O. Bueno.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpui.py: Use img.name if filename is not
	available (bug #158392). Patch by Joao S. O. Bueno.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpfu.py
	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpui.py: Add a palette selector (bug #155325).
	Patch by Joao S. O. Bueno.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpfu.py: Fix -fu slider behavior (bug #155103).
	Patch by Joao S. O. Bueno.
	
2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glasstile.c: Remove unnecessary G_OBJECT() casts.

2004-11-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: 
	* plug-ins/pygimp/Makefile.am: Compile pygimp with
	-fno-strict-aliasing if the compiler supports it.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpui.py: Make "..." into "Browse..." for
	everything but the filesel, for slightly more consistency with
	script-fu. Addresses #124791.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpmodule.c: Wrapped
	gimp_context_{get,set}_gradient and
	gimp_gradient_get_{uniform,custom}_samples. Deprecated the deprecated
	versions of these, and rewrote them in terms of the new functions.

2004-11-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c (plug_in_close): replaced the
	while(plug_in->temp_procs) "loop" which called
	plug_in_proc_frame_quit() by a real for()-loop iterating over the
	list of PlugInProcFrames, calling g_main_loop_quit() on each main
	loop. The old version did not unroll the stack but looped
	infinitely. Spotted by Yosh.

2004-11-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_preferences.c: silent the compiler.

2004-11-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: applied (modified) patch from S. Mukund
	which adds EXIF thumbnail loading and saving.

2004-11-16  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: implemented the gradient fill, using a
	shapeburst blend.  This is very slow, but I dont see how it could be
	done otherwise.

2004-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfgbgeditor.c: get rid of the
	gimp_fg_bg_editor_context_changed() callback and

2004-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c: implement
	GimpDockedInterface::set_context() and set the context of the
	embedded GimpComponentEditor. Fixes NULL-context crashes in
	action callbacks when invoked from the component editor.
	Spotted by Jimmac.

	Unrelated:

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: get rid of the
	gimp_item_tree_view_context_changed() callback and

	directly.

2004-11-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jigsaw.c: added missing braces around initializer.

2004-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

2004-11-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/selection.pdb: entirely removed the deprecated
	functions "selection_clear", "image_set_cmap" and "image_get_cmap".

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: and added them to the compat hash table
	because they have undeprecated replacements with identical
	signature.

	* libgimp/gimpselection.[ch]: added gimp_selection_clear() here
	instead because we need the symbol in libgimp.

	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/selection_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpselection_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.h: renamed the DObject type to
	GfigObject, according to our common type naming.  This type will

	on gimp_item_is_attached() or simply don't push an undo step if
	feasible (e.g. for simple stuff like layer opacity).

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: combined "set_uri_and_proc" and

2004-11-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/glossy.scm: fixed typo (bug #158425).

	tool (a lot more elliptical) by Jimmac and Zigomar.

2004-11-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	limit the number of file extensions that are added to the file
	filter menu to keep the file dialog from growing too wide.

2004-11-15  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Further optimization of
	perspective tool preview - never calculate the same vertex more
	than once.

	* docs/gimp.txt: removed, outdated.
	* docs/make_todo: removed, unused.

2004-11-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/print-size-dialog.c: started to redo this dialog

	isn't usable yet.
	
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressdialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: trivial cleanups.

2004-11-14  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.h: fixed a crash (the one triggered by
	this sequence: draw a line, delete it, redraw something), and
	corrected some ui spacing.

2004-11-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette-import.c: applied a (slightly modified)
	patch from Nickolay V. Shmyrev that changes the palette import
	function to not only read palettes in the RIFF format but also
	GIMP and Photoshop ACT palette files (bug #158297).

2004-11-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST)
	* MAINTAINERS
	* PLUGIN_MAINTAINERS
	* TODO.xml: removed these files from the tarball and from CVS.

	outdated and in large parts wrong information.

	that replaces the XPM icons with pixbufs (bug #140202).

	* plug-ins/pagecurl/curl[0-7].xpm: removed.

2004-11-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: Adapted Sven's code into pdbgen so
	that gimp_image_set_filename() validates that it is called with
	a filename in the filesystem encoding which can safely be converted
	to UTF-8 and back. Fixes #153751.

	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: document the fact that

	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpfileops_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c

2004-11-13  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c: added back <control>H as a shortcut

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.c (gimp_strip_uline): changed based on a

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/README.ifscompose: updated link to the
	tutorial (pointed out by Alan Horkan) and added another link.

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: changed plug-in name from
	"IfsCompose" to "IFS Fractal". Sorry for the late string changes
	but the old name definitely was akward and probably hard to
	translate anyway. Fixes bug #157135.

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_storage.c: removed trailing
	whitespace.

2004-11-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/images/stock-select-object.png: new icons made by
	Jimmac.

2004-11-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c: disallow non-attached items
	to be pushed to the undo stack.

2004-11-12  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/images/stock-show-all.png
	* plug-ins/gfig/images/stock-select-object.png: added these two stock
	icons. Jimmac, these two are screaming to be redone, please.

	* plug-ins/gfig/images/Makefile.am: added these icons.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-poly.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-poly.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-spiral.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-spiral.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-star.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-star.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-stock.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-stock.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: moved all the buttons to a GtkUIManager
	toolbar, which makes the code simpler and easier to read.

2004-11-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/tips-dialog.c: added icons to the Previous/Next
	buttons (bug #158004).

2004-11-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/splash.c: lowered labels a few pixels.

2004-11-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: minor code cleanup.

2004-11-11  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: use a GtkUIManager for the menu and
	automagically have it translated!  The button bar will follow the same
	path.  Remove the now useless "Paint" button.

2004-11-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpconfig-dump.c: groff doesn't like lines to start
	with a single quote, we better escape it. Fixes bug #157971.

	* docs/gimprc.5.in: regenerated.

2004-11-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-edit.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-bucket-fill.c
	* app/core/gimpitem.c (gimp_item_stroke): added precondition
	checks for gimp_item_is_attached() and removed checks for
	gimp_item_get_image() to actually return an image (because it
	always returns an image).

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb: let all wrappers fail if the drawable
	is not attached.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-11-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/add-bevel.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/addborder.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/carve-it.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/carved-logo.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/chip-away.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/clothify.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/font-map.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/slide.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/swirltile.scm: don't call gimp-edit-*
	functions on drawables which are not added to an image because
	this will be forbidden soon (because it can trash the image's undo
	stack).
	
2004-11-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/lava.scm: replaced
	undo-disable/enable by undo-group-start/end.

2004-11-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c (gimp_image_map_tool_response):
	call gimp_image_flush() after committing the image_map so the
	menus are up-to-date. Fixes bug #157914.

2004-11-11  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Use the transform
	tool coordinates when creating subdivisions, not the
	texture coordinates. Fixes breakage with layers that are not
	the image size.

2004-11-11  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* app/base/brush-scale.c: Keep computed brush values from
	overflowing with large reduction factors.  Fixes bug #76228.

2004-11-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintstore.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: please the overly pedantic
	IRIX MIPSpro compiler and don't initialize structs with
	non-constant values.

2004-11-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-open.c (file_open_layer): add the image to the
	list of recently used documents. Fixes bug #157879.

2004-11-10  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: moved the tool options closer to the
	tools and made the dialog a bit smaller.

2004-11-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mail.c: added a menu icon (compiled-in).

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	(gimp_display_shell_resolution_changed_handler): if dot_for_dot is
	off, resolution change has the same effect as size change, so call
	gimp_display_shell_size_changed_handler(). Fixes display garbage.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/icoload.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch]: call progress functions
	unconditionally; removed global "interactive" variable; use
	standard strings for open/save progress messages; gui, indentation
	& coding style cleanup; untabified.

2004-11-10  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: applied a patch from Sven Neumann
	with some minor modifications. Fixes bug #157612
	Removed some unused variables.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.c (gimp_escape_uline): "Since: GIMP 2.2".

2004-11-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: set the padding-mode to custom
	color if a custom color is choosen. Fixes bug #157844.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/plugin-browser.c (browser_dialog_new): fixed
	capitalization of notebook tab label.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.[ch]: renamed gimp_flags_get_value() to
	gimp_flags_get_first_value(). Reordered functions so enum and
	flags functions are grouped together. Added missing docs.

	* libgimpbase/gimpbase.def: changed accordingly.

2004-11-09  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/psd.c: Skip resources with unknown signatures
	instead of quiting.  Fixes bug #142468, and bug #152728

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c: in functions gimp_drawable_mask_bounds,
	and gimp_drawable_mask_intersect: reinitialize the return values
	after calling gimp_channel_bounds because gimp_channel_bounds
	overwrites the values even when it returns false.  This fixes the
	bug where the gimp crashes when running color tools on layers
	smaller than the image, and processes only part of the image when
	the layer is larger than the image size.

2004-11-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* HACKING: some updates.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: use a UI manager created
	toolbar instead of two rows of buttons. Added a "dummy-menubar" so
	the popup menu shows shortcuts again. Removed "Preview" and "Auto"
	buttons since the preview doesn't block the GUI and can always be
	updated.

2004-11-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_statusbar_push_length(), which works exactly like
	push_coords() but takes only one value plus a GimpOrientationType
	for specifying the value's axis.

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]: added the corresponding
	gimp_tool_push_status_length().

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c: use gimp_tool_push_status_length()
	so the guide position is shown in the selected display unit.
	Cleaned up the status message code a bit.

2004-11-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c: use an idle handler to jump to the
	anchor.

2004-11-09  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bmpread.c: if the file has space in the colormap for
	more than 256 entries, ignore them instead of failing. Fixes bug
	#157775.

2004-11-09  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bmpread.c: Fix cut'n'paste err so grayscale images
	load again. Fixes bug #157764.

2004-11-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): pass (gint)-truncated
	coordinates instead of RINT()-rounded ones to
	gimp_display_shell_update_cursor(). Restores correct coordinates
	display for zoomed-in display and fixes bug #153534.

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c: added statusbar messages including the
	(rounded) guide coordinate. Keeps bug #141719 closed.

2004-11-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_new): don't
	connect to "event" and don't connect any canvas event to
	gimp_display_shell_events(). Connect all tool events separately
	(doesn't include "configure-event" and thus fixes bug #141543).

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): call
	gimp_display_shell_events() manually before doing tool event
	processing.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.[ch]: connect to
	"size_allocate" of the canvas, not to "configure_event"
	(suggested by Owen in bug #141543).

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.[ch]: removed
	gimp_display_shell_popup_menu().

	(gimp_display_shell_origin_button_press): emit "popup-menu" on the
	shell manually instead of calling above function.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: added the whole menu popup code
	here.

2004-11-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpoffsetarea.c (gimp_offset_area_resize): queue
	a resize. Fixes remaining issues with bug #157495.

2004-11-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/url.c: removed debug output.

2004-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c (user_install_migrate_files):
	don't copy menurc, the format changed anyway.
	
2004-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_ok):
	actually retrieve the value from the GtkEntry for SF-VALUE.

2004-11-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: applied modified patch from Geert
	Jordaens which adds the missing gimp_layer_from_mask() API.
	Addresses bug #138662.

	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.[ch]. regenerated.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: changed accordingly.

2004-11-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: removed garbage
	from beginning of file. Removed DOS line breaks.

2004-11-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelfetcher.c: added docs derived from a patch from
	Cai Qian (bug #156271).

2004-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c: changed label of default action
	button to "Grab".

2004-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/CEL.c
	* plug-ins/common/CML_explorer.c
	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c
	* plug-ins/common/gqbist.c
	* plug-ins/common/spheredesigner.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: don't set help-ids on plug-in
	file chooser dialogs. Set the default response for file dialogs.

2004-11-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c (resize_dialog_response)
	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.c (scale_dialog_response): replaced
	"case GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL:" by "default:" so it also catches
	hitting the escape key or clicking the WM close button.

2004-11-08  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gqbist.c: fixed typo in construction of file
	chooser, use gtk_dialog_run instead of separate callbacks for
	the responses of the file chooser dialog.

2004-11-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_mask_bounds)
	(gimp_drawable_mask_intersect): initialize the return values before
	checking if the drawable is attached. Keeps GIMP from going mad if
	this assertion is ever triggered.

2004-11-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c: don't connect the help browser to
	the help system.

2004-11-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: register the
	compatibility procedure with the correct name.

2004-11-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorbutton.c: fixed unused code (tooltip was
	taken from label field).

2004-11-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: ported to GtkUIManager.

2004-11-07  Sigurd Gartmann  <sigurd-translate@brogar.org>

	* configure.in: Added support for the new locale nb to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-11-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c (query): the menu label should
	have three dots (bug #157580).

2004-11-07  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c: removed #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED and
	use a GtkListStore instead of the long-time deprecated GtkList. Done
	some small cleanups, too.

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c: changed minimum brush radius from
	1.0 to 0.1.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c: allow a smaller brush radius to
	be set in the brush editor. Fixes bug #157508.

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.c (scale_dialog_reset): same fix here.

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: fixed typo (bug #157513).

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c (convert_dialog_new): removed
	trailing period from check button label. Fixes bug #157511.

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c (resize_dialog_reset): fixed most of
	the Reset functionality (bug #157495). The offset box is still not
	working correctly.

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c (gimp_size_box_update_resolution):
	check for availability of the size entry before accessing it.

2004-11-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	New Win32 icons contributed by Jernej Simoncic:
	
	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/makefile.msc
	* app/gimp.rc
	* app/fileicon.ico: added new file icon for the Win32 build.

	* app/wilber.ico: nicer application icon for the Win32 build.

2004-11-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/maze/maze.c
	* plug-ins/maze/maze_face.c: some irrelevant cleanups while doing
	code review.

2004-11-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: removed #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
	because it's no longer needed. Cleaned up #defines and
	declarations. Removed tabs and trailing whitespace.

2004-11-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c: be more tolerant and silently
	skip entries that the dialog factory doesn't recognize.

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c: minor cleanup.

2004-11-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c (user_install_response): don't
	save the (empty) gimprc after migrating the user settings.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/uniteditor.c: undeprecated by using a
	GtkUIManager for creating the toolbar. Some cleanup and code
	reordering.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: disable the whole bunch of FOO_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
	only for future versions of GLib, GTK+ and Pango because the
	upcoming new stable versions add no new deprecations that are
	relevant for the GIMP source.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: some undeprecation and
	cleanup. Still uses GtkItemFactory.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Don't use deprecated GtkToolbar API in GimpTextEditor:

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/actions.c
	* app/actions/text-editor-actions.[ch]
	* app/actions/text-editor-commands.[ch]: added acions and
	callbacks for the new "text-editor" action group.

	* app/menus/menus.c: register a "<TextEditor>" UI manager.

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/text-editor-toolbar.xml: new file for the toolbar.

	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.[ch]: use the toolbar created by the
	UI manager instead of constructing it using deprecated API.

	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: added gimp_text_buffer_load()
	(used by text-editor-commands.c).

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorbutton.[ch]: use a GtkUIManager instead
	of a GtkItemFactory. Added virtual function ::get_action_type()
	and create the manager's actions manually using that action type
	instead of using gtk_action_group_add_actions().

	* app/widgets/gimpcolorpanel.c: override ::get_action_type() so it
	creates GimpActions (which can have a color attached) instead of
	GtkActions. Changed the menu item visibility and color preview
	code accordingly.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpitemfactory.[ch]: finally removed.

	* configure.in: added -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED to CPPFLAGS again.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpoldwidgets.c: #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpunitmenu.h: #include <gtk/gtkoptionmenu.h>
	explicitely and #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED only around the
	inclusion if it was defined before.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpunitcache.h
	* libgimpbase/gimpchecks.h
	* libgimpbase/gimpdatafiles.h
	* libgimpbase/gimplimits.h
	* libgimpbase/gimpmemsize.h
	* libgimpbase/gimputils.h

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-enums.h
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-error.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.h: added G_BEGIN_DECLS / G_END_DECLS.

2004-11-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/ccanalyze.c
	* plug-ins/common/uniteditor.c

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_toolbar.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_tools.c
	* plug-ins/print/gimp_color_window.c: stop using deprecated
	functions, added some #undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED where needed.

2004-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/module-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbrowser.c
	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/plugin-browser.c: use
	gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first() instead of the deprecated
	_get_iter_root().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: don't include
	"widgets/gimpitemfactory.h".

2004-11-03  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* app/base/gimphistogram.h: %s/historgam/histogram/
	
2004-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdasheditor.c (gimp_dash_editor_finalize): don't
	forget to g_free(editor->segments).

2004-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpscalecombobox.c
	(gimp_scale_combo_box_mru_remove_last)
	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_add_action_button)
	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c (xcf_load_old_path): plugged some small leaks.

2004-11-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_add_filters):
	plugged a mem-leak.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererimagefile.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_imagefile_render): don't leak the pixbuf here.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer-frame.c: added a comment.

2004-11-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c (combine_sub_region): applied
	patch from Joao S. O. Bueno which moves assignments into an "else"
	branch and thus optimizes the (common) "if" branch. Did some
	cosmetic cleanups.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_interface):
	don't silently return when there is already a script running but
	show a message instead. Unfortunately introduces two new strings,
	but bugs are bugs. Fixes bug #123882.

2004-11-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c (gimp_imagefile_save_thumb): minor
	cleanup.

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.c (_gimp_thumbs_delete_others): do
	the right thing. Used to do the wrong thing when called with a
	thumbnail size which is not from the GimpThumbSize enum.

2004-11-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-commands.c (image_new_from_image_cmd_callback):
	call image_new_dialog_set() unconditionally. Fixes bug #157096.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: factored out the
	"invoke" bodies to two utility functions, getting rid of *tons* of
	duplicated code.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c: regenerated (only whitespace
	and comments changed).

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb (drawable_*_defaults):
	renamed parameter "interpolation" to "interpolate" as suggested by
	pippin.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawabletransform_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c (user_install_migrate_files):
	don't copy pluginrc* and themerc*.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpimage.h: one more s/cmap/colormap/.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/transform_tools.pdb: deprecated all functions.

	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimptransformtools_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/image-structure.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/perspective-shadow.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/text-circle.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/truchet.scm: use the new transform API.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: added _defaults()
	variants (flip_defaults, rotate_defaults, ...) for all transform
	functions which finally call gimp_drawable_transform_affine().
	The _defaults() functions don't take the whole interpolation_type,
	supersample etc. parameter overkill, but only a "interpolation"
	boolean like the old PDB wrappers.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawabletransform_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: renamed flip() and
	rotate() to flip_simple() and rotate_simple(). Renamed flip_free()
	and rotate_free() to flip() and rotate() (the special cases should
	have a special suffix, not the general ones).

	* libgimp/gimp.def: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawabletransform_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/compressor.c (compressors): added missing bzip2
	command lines for Win32.

	instead of the deprecated "cmap" ones.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	More final API cleanup:

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: added gimp_image_set,get_colormap()
	and deprecated set,get_cmap().

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: renamed
	gimp_preview_area_set_cmap() to set_colormap().

	* libgimp/gimp.def
	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* libgimp/gimpexport.c
	* libgimp/gimpimage.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpimage_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	(undeprecation of plug-ins will follow...)

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c (crop_recalc): added "gboolean
	recalc_highlight" and call gimp_display_shell_set_highlight() only
	when it's TRUE. Pass TRUE from all places where the crop outline
	actually changed.

	(gimp_crop_tool_control): added back the call to crop_recalc() for
	the RESUME case so the outline gets updated on zoom/scroll, but pass
	recalc_highlight = FALSE because it has not changed.
	Fixes bug #157001.

2004-11-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb (flip): renamed
	parameter "center" to "auto_center" and removed
	"transform_direction". Renamed rotate() to rotate_free() and
	added a "gboolean auto_center" parameter. Added new function
	rotate() which takes enum GimpRotationType instead of an
	arbiatrary angle so the flip and rotate APIs are symmetric.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added the gimp_drawable_transform_* stuff.

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawabletransform_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-11-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/image-scale-dialog.c (image_scale_callback): actually
	use the choosen interpolation type. Fixes bug #157102.

2004-11-02  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-types.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: some more cleanups. The current_style bug is
	still there :(

2004-11-01  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c: applied patch from David Gowers, extra sanity
	checking for the xcf loader, colormaps read from non indexed images
	are discarded. Does not fix bug #134097, but prevents gimp from
	reloading an impossible state.

2004-11-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.[ch]
	(gimp_drawable_transform_flip): renamed "center" to "auto_center".

	(gimp_drawable_transform_rotate): added missing parameters so it
	can be used for a to-be-added PDB wrapper offering a
	GimpRotationType based rotate API.

	Both functions: always clip when transforming a whole channel,
	since they must keep their size.

	(gimp_drawable_transform_affine): actually forward the passed
	"clip_result" to transform_tiles_affine() instead of always FALSE.

2004-11-01  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpcolor_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimpcolor_pdb.h: regenerated
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb: added levels-stretch to @procs, removed
	metainformation from deprecated levels-auto.

	* libgimp/gimpcolor_pdb.c
	* menus/image-menu.xml
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb: renamed [drawable-]levels-auto
	to [drawable-]levels-stretch, anticipating other ways to automatically
	determine levels settings, old PDB command maintained, but marked
	as deprecated.

2004-11-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_add_filters):
	don't check for file_proc->menu_paths. Our load and save procedure
	don't necessarily register a menu path any longer.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c: minor cleanup.

	* app/xcf/xcf.c (xcf_init): no need for adding menu paths for the
	XCF load and save procedures.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: fixed outdated documentation.

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpfileops_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-11-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: added "clip_result" to
	the transform_options_args() utility function and changed all
	wrappers accordingly. Removed "interpolation", "supersample" and
	"recursion_level" args from drawable_transform_flip().

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawabletransform_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-11-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c (query): fixed typo.

2004-11-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/drawable-actions.c: trailing whitespace.

	* app/actions/drawable-commands.[ch]: partly revert alphabetical
	ordering. Instead, group them as in drawable-actions.c and order
	by alphabet inside the groups (different ordering in *-actions.c
	and *-commands.c is inconvenient for the usual workflow of editing
	both files at the same time).

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-levels.h: indentation.

2004-11-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* themes/Small/gtkrc: don't change GtkDialog::button_spacing and
	::action_area_border because it breaks alignment with all other
	dialog spacings or borders (which are hardcoded).

2004-11-01  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-types.h: new file to hold the types gfig uses.
	This makes the sources easier to read.

	* plug-ins/gfig/Makefile.am: added gfig-types.h

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: removed some types definitions and put them
	in gfig-types.h and ...

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.h
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.h: ...into these files.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.2-pre1 release.

2004-10-31  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* data/images/gimp-splash.png: new splash based on a great photo
	(and pumpkin) by Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>.

2004-10-31  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plasma.c: Fixed handling of 1x1 selection and
	selection out of drawable.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): removed pix-data.h.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: changed gimp_version to 2.2-pre1, to match the
	naming scheme of the 2.0 pre-releases.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: removed an unused variable.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c: when migrating the user
	settings, tolerate errors and create the tmp directory that was
	explicitely not copied.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpconfig-utils.c (gimp_config_file_copy): copy the
	file permissions also.

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c: added code to migrate user
	settings from ~/.gimp-2.0. It copies all files (except GIMP swap
	files) and all subdirectories (except tmp) with all files. It
	doesn't recurse into subdirectories.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.c: disabled the image area by default
	to reduce some clutter.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c: fixed page logic for migration
	of user settings. Still missing code to actually copy the files.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpmemsizeentry.c: don't use camel case in memory
	size identifiers.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpimageeditor.c (gimp_image_editor_set_context):
	set the active image. Fixes bug #156942.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/user-install-dialog.c: started to work on migration of
	user settings (bug #156636). Not at all functional yet.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c: allow for mnemonics in radio
	groups created with gimp_radio_group_new().

2004-10-31  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c: some more UI improvements.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: added a size entry to edit the
	resolution. This should close bug #151022.

2004-10-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c: connect the offset controls.

2004-10-30  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dobject.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c: fixed some annoying popup messages at
	the price of a smallish mem-leak that I will fix later.

2004-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-generic.c
	(gimp_composite_hue_any_any_any_generic): do nothing if the color
	has no saturation. Patch by Joao S. Bueno. Fixes bug #123296.

2004-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-commands.c (image_scale_cmd_callback): destroy
	the scale dialog when the display is disconnected.

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c: fixed a couple of bugs related to
	the offset area. Still work in progress.

2004-10-30  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: Moved the preview to the left, as
	suggested by Joao S. O. Bueno.

	work in progress.

	* plug-ins/gfig/pix-data.h: removed this empty, unused file.

2004-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h
	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/tools/gimpmoveoptions.[ch]

	Instead added a gimprc option that allows to get the old behaviour
	back.

2004-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpmoveoptions.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.[ch]: applied (cleaned up version of) a
	patch from Joao S. O. Bueno that adds a tool-option to restore the
	old Move tool behaviour. Fixes bug #156801.

2004-10-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c: applied a patch from Geert Jordaens
	that improves the Despeckle algorithm. See bug #72862.

2004-10-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.c (gimp_ui_manager_entry_load)
	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.c (gimp_clipboard_init): only be
	verbose on request.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c (plug_in_close): turned warnings into
	messages and respect gimp->be_verbose.

	* app/actions/drawable-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/drawable-actions.[ch]: alphabetized file pending
	addition.

	use of SF-PALETTE.

2004-10-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	gimp_image_set_filename(). Fixes bug #153751 for the JPEG plug-in.

2004-10-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-utils.c (file_utils_uri_to_utf8_filename): when
	the filename cannot be converted to UTF-8, warn and return the URI
	instead. This is a workaround for the crash described in bug #153751.

2004-10-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c (toplevel_entries): added foreign entries
	for the keyboard shortcut and the controller action dialogs.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollereditor.c: register the dialogs with
	the "toplevel" dialog factory so they remember their size and
	position.

2004-10-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/gimpprocbrowser.c
	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/plugin-browser.c: don't say "1 Procedures" or
	"1 Plug-In Interfaces" but use the singular form instead.

2004-10-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c
	* plug-ins/common/nova.c: changed preview cursors to GDK_CROSSHAIR.

	* plug-ins/common/iwarp.c
	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c
	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: added GDK_CROSSHAIR preview
	cursors. Not quite perfect for IfsCompose (actually needs tool-
	and constext-sensitive cursors) but definitely better than
	before. Fixes bug #90519.

2004-10-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb: mention gimp_drawable_fill() in the
	docs for gimp_edit_fill().

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpedit_pdb.c: regenerated.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablecombobox.c
	* libgimp/gimpimagecombobox.c: changed the API docs to suggest to
	use gimp_int_combo_box_connect() with these widgets. We don't want
	more people to be caught by bug #156659.

2004-10-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: fixed a long-standing cut'n'paste bug

	shade of gray when drawing on a grayscale drawable.

2004-10-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.c: added the offset area back. Still
	work in progress.

2004-10-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c: only create a "Document not
	found" error page if the requested URL was a page to load, not a
	supplementary URL like an image. Fixes bug #138275.

	the "layers-mask-add" action insensitive if there's no alpha channel.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c (layers_add_mask_response): add an
	alpha channel if there isn't one already. Fixes bug #156676.

2004-10-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_interface):
	use gimp_int_combo_box_connect() so that the initial selection
	causes the "changed" callback to be run. Should fix bug #156659.

2004-10-28  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Improve preview accuracy of
	perspective transform, by subdiving into a 5x5 grid.

	Fixes bug #152222.

2004-10-27  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	using triangles instead of quads.

2004-10-27  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Hopefully fixed all cases

2004-10-27  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-bezier.[ch]: added a notebook page for the
	bezier tool options instead of yet another popup window.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: modified accordingly and HIGed a bit.

2004-10-27  Øyvind Kolås  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c: made the fixed point used in
	supersampling configurable (in source) and changed from 15.16 to
	21.10 fixed point.
	
	Fixes bug #128594 for drawables less than 2G wide.

2004-10-27  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@gmx.de>

2004-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/enumcode.pl: fixed loop control in
	_gimp_enums_init(). This caused all plug-ins to crash immidiately.
	You will need to make sure that libgimp/gimpenums.c.tail is
	recreated and appended to libgimp/gimpenums.c

2004-10-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-transform-utils.[ch]. switch from x1,y1,x2,y2
	bounding boxes to x,y,width,height ones. Added
	gimp_transform_matrix_flip_free(). Renamed some parameters to be
	consistent with others. Some internal cleanup.

	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/transform_tools.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/transform_tools.pdb: guard all transform
	wrappers with if(gimp_drawable_mask_intersect(...)), also the
	ones which don't need the returned bounding box.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable_transform.pdb: renamed some parameters
	and added gimp_drawable_transform_matrix() which takes the 9
	coefficients of a 3x3 matrix for ultimate flexibility ;)

	* app/pdb/drawable_transform_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c

	an indexed image.

2004-10-27  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpaspectpreview.c: really use the second parameter of
	gimp_aspect_preview_new (), so plug-ins can now really remember the
	state of the preview between invocations.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpscrolledpreview.c: fix a little typo

	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c: fix a warning by using TRUE for a
	boolean value (initial state of the preview) instead of a weird NULL.

2004-10-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* modules/controller_midi.c: don't g_free(error) but
	g_clear_error(&error) the GError.

2004-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/resize-dialog.[ch]: started to redo the Resize
	dialog in the style of the new Scale dialog. Only halfway done but
	at least the new API is there.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/dialogs/image-scale-dialog.c: cosmetics.

2004-10-27  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	files gimpdrawabletranform_pdb.[ch].

2004-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/image-scale-dialog.[ch]: a wrapper around the scale
	dialog that takes care of verifying the user input and optionally
	asking for confirmation. Most of this moved out of image-commands.c.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c: use the new image scale dialog
	even though it doesn't allow to edit the resolution yet. That's a
	temporary regression that will get fixed soon.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: cosmetics.

	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.c (scale_dialog_reset): also reset the
	resolution.

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: fixed cut'n'paste error.

2004-10-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.[ch]: added a resolution label similar
	to one in the template editor. Prepared for editable resolution,
	work in progress...

	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.[ch]: added resolution and resolution
	unit parameters to ScaleDialogCallback.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: changed accordingly.

2004-10-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: commented out the memory size
	label. The visual clutter of it's bold appearance was IMO not
	appropriate. I think the dialog is better without it.

	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.c: added a pixel size label as in the
	Image New dialog.

2004-10-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/enumcode.pl: added gtk-doc comment for
	gimp_enums_get_type_names().

2004-10-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	lets Retinex deal with RGBA drawables. Closes bug #135594 again.

2004-10-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Added new drawable transform API to the PDB. Largely based on
	patches from Joao S. O. Bueno. Fixes bug #137053.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.[ch]: added missing parameters
	to gimp_drawable_transform_flip().

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/transform_tools.pdb: changed accordinly.

	* app/core/core-enums.h: removed pdp-skip for GimpInterpolationType
	and GimpTransformDirection enums.

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* modules/controller_midi.c: don't enter an infinite blocking loop
	when the user selects an input file that can be opened, but not
	read (like a directory).

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.[ch] (gimp_action_view_new): added
	parameter "const gchar *select_action" and preselect the passed
	action if non-NULL. Made the column enum public to users of this
	widget can get data from its tree store.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_keyboard_shortcuts_dialog):
	pass NULL because we don't want a preselected action here.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollereditor.[ch]: added "Edit" and "Delete"
	buttons to change the event -> action mapping. Implement a action
	chooser dialog using GimpActionView. Fixes bug #106920.

2004-10-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/core/gimpchannel-select.c
	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c
	* app/core/gimpundo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c: use the new enum utility
	functions from libgimpbase instead of accessing enum_value->value_name.

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c (quit_dialog_container_changed): when
	changing the button's label to "Quit", also make it the default
	action.

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollereditor.[ch]: new widget built from
	preliminary code from the prefs dialog. Prerequisite for finally
	fixing bug #106920.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: use the new widget.

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/retinex.c: cleaned up the GUI and GIMP-specific
	code a bit. Use gimp_drawable_mask_intersect().

	regexp group.

2004-10-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c (marshall_proc_db_call):

2004-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c (marshall_proc_db_call):
	silently accept arrays which are longer than specified. Nothing
	bad can happen and it's common practice to resize arrays in fixed
	size chunks so avoid frequent resizing. Fixes bug #155359.

2004-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c (init_constants): removed

	* tools/pdbgen/enumcode.pl: removed code to generate 
	plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.c, generate code to
	explicitely initialize and query all of libgimp*'s enums
	and write it to libgimp/gimpenums.c.tail

	* libgimp/gimpenums.h: regenerated.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am: append gimpenums.c.tail to gimpenums.c

	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_main): call g_type_init() and
	_gimp_enums_init().

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added gimp_enums_get_type_names().

	* plug-ins/script-fu/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.[ch]: removed these files.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: dynamically register all

	Also register the built-in unit types.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: changed accordingly.

2004-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Don't store human readable and translatable enum/flag strings in
	GEnumValue's and GTypeValue's fields but attach them to their
	GType using separate structs and utility functions:

	generating a second array of values, which is used by the
	Makefiles below to create and register arrays of value
	descriptions.

	* libgimpbase/gimpbasetypes.[ch]: added API to attach/retreive
	arrays of translatable strings to/from enum and flags types. Added
	structs GimpEnumDesc and GimpFlagsDesc for that purpose.

	functions, added new ones and added a symmetric API for flags.

	* app/base/Makefile.am

	just gimputils.h

2004-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: commented out the "Debug" submenu.
	Should do this via an xsltproc --param actually...

2004-10-25  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: removed debugging g_print and
	remove my memory fix, since it was buggy and shouldn't be done.
	My fix just broke this plug-in (reported by Joao S. O. Bueno
	Calligaris)

2004-10-25  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

2004-10-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c (gimp_imagefile_get_desc_string): say
	"Click to create preview" if no preview is available.

2004-10-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: added gimp_text_buffer_save()
	which saves a GtkTextBuffer's contents to a file.

	gimp_editor_add_action_button() and removed all "clicked"
	callbacks, including all file saving code.

	* app/actions/error-console-actions.c

	above to the action callbacks. Use gimp_text_buffer_save().

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.[ch]: added public APIs for
	zooming the editors. Use gimp_editor_add_action_button() to create

	the editor's UI manager if it exists.

	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-commands.[ch]: added zoom actions

	even to crash GIMP).

	* app/actions/palette-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/palette-editor-commands.[ch]: changed "new" and
	"zoom" actions to actually do their job instead of calling

	for the edit action.

	* app/actions/colormap-editor-commands.c: implement the dialog
	here.

2004-10-24  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-desaturate.c: only return early if there's
	nothing to desaturate.

2004-10-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: don't leak the filenames of the
	import and export dialogs.

2004-10-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/vectors-export-dialog.[ch]
	* app/dialogs/vectors-import-dialog.[ch]: new files.

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: use the new dialogs and remember
	their last values.

2004-10-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: added missing controls to the
	path import and export dialogs.

2004-10-23  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: cleaned it up, fixed a (documented)
	memory leak and the weird behaviour of the resolution scales.

2004-10-23  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/newsprint.c: added a preview.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpaspectpreview.h
	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.h
	* libgimp/gimpprogressbar.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcellrenderercolor.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcellrenderertoggle.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintcombobox.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintstore.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpscrolledpreview.h: added padding to all class
	structs which have been added since 2.0.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_save_cmd_callback): don't
	g_return_if_fail() if there is no active drawable, just silently
	return.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c: remember the last merge_type of
	the "Merge Visible Layers" dialog.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: remeber the last values of the
	"Add Layer Mask" dialog.

	* app/actions/select-commands.c: renamed a bunch of static
	variables to be consistent with other variables used to remember
	dialog values.

	* app/actions/view-commands.c (view_fullscreen_cmd_callback): it's
	useless to update the "view-fullscreen" actions here because the
	"fullscreen" state of the shell changes asynchronously

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/image-merge-layers-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/layer-add-mask-dialog.c: made them not resizable.

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/offset-dialog.c: renamed ugly variables.

	* app/dialogs/image-new-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/stroke-dialog.c: irrelevant pedantic code reordering.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/image-merge-layers-dialog.[ch]: one more dialog split
	out of actions/.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c: removed it here. Some cleanup.

2004-10-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.[ch]
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.[ch]
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb.def: added missing API, mainly for deleting
	thumbnails.

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.[ch]: when saving a thumbnail, delete a
	failure thumbnail if one exists. Unless the thumbnail was created
	explicitely, remove all other thumbnails for this image.

	* app/actions/documents-commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/file/file-open.c: only save a thumbnail if there isn't a
	valid thumbnail already.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: before attempting to create a new
	thumbnail, check if there's an uptodate failure thumbnail.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/layer-add-mask-dialog.[ch]: one more dialog split
	out of actions/.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: removed it here. Some cleanup.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: don't tell nonsense by printing "I am going to run
	./configure with no arguments", because we always pass at least
	--enable-maintainer-mode. Instead, simply always print all
	arguments. Also removed --copy from the calls to glib-gettextize
	and intltoolize.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.c: added labels ("_Stroke") to the
	SLEECTION_STROKE and PATH_STROKE stock items so they can be used
	in action areas.

	* app/widgets/gimpstrokeeditor.c: changed mnemonic to no clash
	with "_Stroke" and reordered some code.

	* app/dialogs/stroke-dialog.[ch]: use the passed stock_id instead
	of GTK_STOCK_OK. Added parameters to specify the dialog's title
	so it doesn't say "Stroke Options".

	* app/actions/select-commands.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: pass "Stroke Selection" and "Stroke
	Path" as dialog titles.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	When there are variants of actions with and without dialog, let
	the dialog-less actions try to use the values from the last dialog
	invocation:

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/channels-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: renamed the foo-new-defaults
	actions to foo-new-last-values and use the last values entered in
	the dialogs.

	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: changed accordingly. Show
	the dialog on clicking "New" and call the last-values action on
	<shift>+click.

	* app/actions/select-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: renamed the foo-stroke-last-vals
	to -last-values.

	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: stroke with last values on
	<shift> clicking the stroke buttons.

2004-10-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c (gimp_thumbnail_save): save to a
	temporary file to avoid problems with concurrent thumbnail
	creation.

2004-10-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/layer-options-dialog.[ch]: the new/edit layer dialog.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: use it here.

2004-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: allow to Shift-click the Load and
	Save buttons to skip the file chooser dialog and reuse the last
	used filename. Fixes bug #75558.

2004-10-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/template-options-dialog.[ch]: the new/edit template
	dialog.

	* app/actions/templates-commands.c: removed the code here and use
	template_options_dialog_new(). Removed utility functions. Some
	cleanup.

2004-10-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_ensure_button_box): make
	sure the button_box is always interted at the very bottom of the
	editor.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewabledialog.c: changed the "description"
	property from CONSTRUCT_ONLY to CONSTRUCT.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c: show the index of the edited
	color in the color dialog and use the correct icon. Replaced label
	"Hex triplet" by "HTML notation" to be consistent with the color
	dialog. Removed wrong 2 pixel border around the table below the
	preview.

2004-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: fixed non-interactive call with default
	values.

2004-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/dialogs-actions.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-colormap.c
	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c: use the term "Colormap"
	instead of "Indexed Palette". Fixes bug #155829.

2004-10-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wmf.c: applied a patch by Karine Proot that adds
	a preview to the load dialog and a similar UI as the SVG loader.
	Fixes bug #133519 and bug #133521.

2004-10-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: added new enum GimpStrokeMethod which
	can be one of { LIBART, PAINT_CORE }.

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/gimpstrokedesc.[ch]: new object which encapsulates
	the params and setup logic for the different stroke methods.

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: use it in GimpItem::stroke() and
	in the gimp_item_stroke() wrapper.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c (gimp_channel_stroke)
	* app/core/gimpselection.c (gimp_selection_stroke)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_stroke): changed accprdingly.

	* app/actions/select-commands.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c
	* app/dialogs/stroke-dialog.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: use GimpStrokeDesc. Simplifies the
	code quite a bit.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-10-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: remember the param_spec with each
	radio button instead of with the box/frame around them.

2004-10-21 Kevin Cozens <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu.c: Removed _() tag from two strings
	that should not have been marked for translation.

2004-10-21  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts-fu.c: Fixed spelling error.

2004-10-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/select-actions.c
	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: added actions and callbacks
	to stroke with the last values used without showing the stroke
	dialog. The actions have no menu entries but can be called via
	shortcuts. Fixes bug #135746.

	(Disclaimer: the uglyness of the callbacks shows the need for a
	stroke API overhaul).

2004-10-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-stroke.c
	(gimp_drawable_stroke_scan_convert): Replacing the call to
	gimp_channel_is_empty() by a simple gimp_drawable_mask_intersect()
	was wrong because gimp_channel_is_empty() makes sure that the
	selection doesn't mask itself while being stroked.

2004-10-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/raw.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea.

2004-10-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/raw.c: new plug-in from Tim Copperfield, made
	work with the GIMP 2.1 API by Philipp Gühring, then heavily
	cleaned up and undeprecated by myself. Fixes bug #144943.
	
	(still uses GtkPreview, but i wanted a sane state in cvs to diff
	 against before replacing it)

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

2004-10-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fixed bug #155733 for libgimp:

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb: export drawable_mask_intersect()
	to the PDB and improved documentation for drawable_mask_bounds().

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: changed accordingly.

2004-10-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: added gimp_drawable_mask_intersect()
	which returns the same bounding box as gimp_drawable_mask_bounds(),
	but returns TRUE only if there is a non-empty intersection between
	the drawable and the selection, or no selection at all. It also
	returns the intersection as x,y,width,height instead of the
	eeky x1,y1,x2,y2.

	* app/core/gimp-edit.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-bucket-fill.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-desaturate.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-equalize.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-histogram.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-invert.c
	* app/core/gimpdrawable-stroke.c
	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/transform_tools.pdb: either switch from
	gimp_drawable_mask_bounds() to _intersect() or check the return
	values of _mask_bounds() manually to avoid operations on empty
	areas. Return successfully because it's a nop, not a failure.
	Fixes bug #155733 for the core.

	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.c (gimp_text_options_gui): removed
	3 mnemonics. No other tool options label has a mnemonic.
	Addresses bug #155861.

2004-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/vectors-options-dialog.[ch]: one more dialog split
	out of actions/.

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: removed it here. Merged more
	utility functions into their only callers.

	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c
	* app/actions/edit-commands.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.c
	* app/actions/palettes-commands.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.c: renamed "qbox" and "query_box"
	variables to "dialog".

2004-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c (shoot_dialog): don't forget to set
	the mnemonic widgets for the labels. Fixes bug #155811.

2004-10-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/channel-options-dialog.[ch]: new files implementing
	the channel options dialog with a horrid number of 13 construction
	parameters. Still better than having the same code twice, only
	differing in strings used...

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/actions/qmask-commands.c: removed the dialog code here and
	use channel_options_dialog_new().

2004-10-19  Jay Cox  <jaycox@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/psd_save.c: don't try to save psd files that are
	larger than 30000 pixels in either direction.  Fixed the rle code
	to compress more compactly.  Fixed a memmory leak in
	save_channel_data.

2004-10-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Action code review and pre-release consistency cleanup:

	* app/actions/*-actions.c: added some missing and resolved
	conflicting mnemonics, added missing help IDs. Cleaned up the
	*_actions_update() functions.

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (*_actions_update): simplified
	the code that figures the prev and next channel,layer,vectors.

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c: use the same accelerator for
	"qmask-active" and "qmask-toggle". Fixed action sensitivity.

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c
	* app/actions/documents-commands.c
	* app/actions/gradients-commands.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c
	* app/actions/palettes-commands.c
	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/actions/select-commands.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: folded tons of private utility
	functions into their only callers (they used to be public and
	called from outside before the switch to action based menus).
	Renamed functions and variables saying "query" or "qbox" to
	"dialog". Moved static functions to the end of the files. Misc
	minor cleanups.

	* app/actions/drawable-actions.c
	* app/actions/drawable-commands.c: made the "drawable-visible" and
	"drawable-linked" actions affect the layer if the active drawable
	is a layer mask.

	* app/actions/select-commands.c: added action to stroke with the
	last values used in an attempt to address bug #135746 but #if 0'ed
	it because the approach is too ugly.

	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c: changed mnemonic from I to S.

	* menus/image-menu-xml.in: added more stuff to the (commented out)
	"context" menu.

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: some more clues in the documentation
	(suggested by nomis)

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: clarify some usecases for
	gimp_pixel_rgn_init().

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c: Added a preview.

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glasstile.c: use a GimpDrawablePreview.

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/borderaverage.c: smallish cleanups.

2004-10-17  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/displace.c: Added a preview and minor cleanups.
	Can someone provide useful testcases for this plug-in?

2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.[ch]: moved "item_type" and
	"signal_name" from GimpItemTreeView to GimpItemTreeViewClass.
	Removed them from gimp_item_tree_view_new(). Require the view_type
	instead of item_type in gimp_item_tree_view_new().

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdrawabletreeview.c (get_type): made them
	abstract base classes.

	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c (class_init): set the
	item_type and signal_name members if GimpItemTreeViewClass.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.c: changed accordingly.

2004-10-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: Add support for automake 1.9. Also rm autom4te.cache,
	since it might interfere with differing autoconf versions.

2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added utility function
	gimp_ui_manager_get_action() which takes "group_name" and
	"action_name".

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: use it.

2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/documents-actions.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c: added more tooltips for actions
	which are used as extended dialog button callbacks.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_add_action_button): keep
	the list of extended actions in reverse order.

	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: don't set the tooltips
	manually. Removes another bunch of insane translatable multiline
	format strings. Pass the extended actions in the right order
	to gimp_editor_add_action_button().

2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c (vectors_linked_cmd_callback):
	call gimp_item_set_linked(), not gimp_item_set_visible().
	Fixes bug #155578

2004-10-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Ported the layers, channels and paths dialogs from
	gimp_editor_add_button() to gimp_editor_add_action_button(),
	removing a massive amount of duplicated code, sensitivity logic
	and confusing utility functions.

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c
	* app/actions/channels-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: added "foo-new-default"
	actions and callbacks which create items without a dialog,
	optionally using default values from a passed template. Removed
	all public utility function that were passed as function pointers
	to widget construtors. Added tooltips to all actions which are now
	used for dialog buttons.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_add_action_button):
	automatically create multi-line tooltips showing the modifiers for
	extended action buttons. Removes the need for lots of insane
	format strings that need to be translated correctly.

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.[ch] (struct GimpItemTreeViewClass):
	replaced tooltip and help_id strings by action names.

	(struct GimpItemTreeView)
	(gimp_item_tree_view_new): removed "edit", "new" and "activate"
	function pointers.

	(gimp_item_tree_view_constructor): create all buttons
	with gimp_editor_add_action_button(), using the action names
	from GimpItemTreeViewClass.

	Removed tons of "clicked" callbacks and all code which sets the
	buttons' sensitivity. They are not needed any longer.

	Require all subclasses to implement GimpItemTreeView::new_item(),
	a new virtual function which creates a plain new item without
	showing a dialog.

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawabletreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: fill in the action names and
	implement GimpItemTreeView::new_item(). Removed all button
	sensitivity logic.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.c: changed accordingly. Doesn't
	include anything from actions/ any more.

2004-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: fixed parameter descriptions for
	layer_add_mask() and layer_remove_mask().

	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/images-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/templates-commands.[ch]: made some public functions
	private or removed them entirely by folding their code into their
	callers. They used to be passed as function pointers to widgets in
	the pre action-based dialog buttons era.

2004-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c: raise the image's displays on
	double-click in the dirty image list.

2004-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fixed bug #155328:

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (vectors_actions_update): don't
	set the "selection to path" actions sensitive if there is no
	image.

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: update the UI manager after
	setting the view's image. Connect to GimpImage::flush() and
	update the UI manager in the callback, too.

2004-10-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c (view_zoom_actions): removed
	duplicate "view-zoom-in" action (cut'n'paste error) and fixed the
	swapped "zoom in/out a lot" actions. Fixes bug #155446.

2004-10-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.1.7 release.

2004-10-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: removed the "Density" label.
	It wasn't helpful and caused the transform options to be wider than
	necessary.

	* app/tools/gimpblendoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: let combo boxes expand
	horizontally like we do in other (all?) dialogs.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c
	(gimp_template_editor_aspect_callback): update the pixel size label.

2004-10-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* data/images/gimp-splash.png: new splash by Jimmac.

2004-10-15  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/scatter_hsv.c: ported to GimpDrawablePreview, and
	removed many lines of codes.

2004-10-14  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/neon.scm: Fixed minor error in script.
	(Related to bug #153900 and compatability with Tiny-Fu)

2004-10-14  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/neon.c: fixed the handling of drawable with alpha.

2004-10-14  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/nlfilt.c: Ported to GimpDrawablePreview, the
	previous preview was absolutely useless. Done some cleanups, too.

	* plug-ins/common/spread.c: remember the preview state between
	invocations.

2004-10-14  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/emboss.c: use a GimpDrawablePreview instead of a
	GimpAspectPreview, since this plug-in is somewhat edge-oriented and
	this makes the code simpler ;)

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* themes/Default/images/stock-gradient-bilinear-16.png
	* themes/Default/images/stock-gradient-linear-16.png: rotate them
	by 90 degrees. All our gradient previews and icons go left->right,
	not top->bottom.

2004-10-14  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bmpread.c: Make sure we have a bpp value we can
	handle, and fail gracefully if not. Fixes bug #155401.

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c
	* app/widgets/gimpenumwidgets.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c
	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c
	* app/tools/gimpblendoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolorbalancetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolorizetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcoloroptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimphuesaturationtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpinkoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimpselectionoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: the child of a GimpFrame must
	not have any border width. Fixes many subtle misalignments.

2004-10-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpprogress.[ch]: added "message" function to the
	GimpProgress interface. Call gimp_message() if it is unimplemented.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.[ch]: added new function
	plug_in_progress_message() that passes the message to the current
	proc_frame's progress.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: implement GimpProgress::message.
	Just do nothing in the implementation. We don't want to see
	messages from file plug-ins that we use to create the thumbnails.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/message.pdb
	* app/pdb/message_cmds.c: if there's a current plug-in, dispatch
	the message by calling plug_in_progress_message().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: fixed wrong types in
	function calls.

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolordialog.c (gimp_color_dialog_new): use
	GIMP_HELP_COLOR_DIALOG as help_id.

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/dialogs-commands.c: purely cosmetic.

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: register GimpConvertPaletteType with
	the type system.

	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: regenerated.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_enum_radio_frame_add):
	fixed to insert the widget at the right place in the radio box.

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c: use enum widgets and
	gimp_enum_radio_frame_add(), resulting in a much better looking
	dialog with much less lines of code.

2004-10-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/helpbrowser/dialog.c: changed "Home" button to "Index".
	"Home" is misleading and leads to problems in some locales (see
	bug #148120).

2004-10-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: correct UTF-8 spelling of
	João S. O. Bueno Calligaris.

	* AUTHORS
	* app/dialogs/authors.h: regenerated.

2004-10-14  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/circuit.scm: Fixed to allow use of
	script on original layer.  (bug #155358)  Fixed spelling error.

2004-10-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am: Remove stamp files during
	maintainer-clean. Addresses bug #155357. Also flesh out the
	dependencies some so rebuilds get triggered when all their
	dependent files change.

2004-10-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_revert_cmd_callback): creata
	an UTF-8 filename from the image URI and display that instead of
	the URI.

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c (convert_dialog_new): removed the
	palette size warning for transparent images. The number of colors
	is already adjusted to 255. This text was IMO more frightening
	than helpful.

2004-10-13  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/add-bevel.scm: two variables were
	not defined before first use (bug #153900).

2004-10-13  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c: Fixed a spelling error.

2004-10-13  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colorify.c: Added a preview.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: removed trailing whitespace.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added
	gimp_preview_set_default_cursor.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpmessagedialog.c: improved handling of parent
	widget; probably just being paranoid here.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/dialogs/image-new-dialog.c: ported memory size confirmation
	dialogs to GimpMessageDialog.

2004-10-13  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: added a new function to set the
	default cursor on preview: gimp_preview_set_default_cursor().

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpscrolledpreview.c: changed accordlingly.

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c:
	* plug-ins/common/nova.c: use this function.

	This addresses bug #90519.

2004-10-13  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cubism.c: Added a preview and done some cleanups.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/plug-in-commands.c
	* app/actions/templates-commands.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.c: ported more boolean queries
	to GimpMessageDialog.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpmessagedialog.c: handle parent widget not being
	a GtkWindow by calling gtk_widget_get_toplevel().

	* app/actions/data-commands.c
	* app/actions/edit-commands.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.c: ported more boolean queries to
	GimpMessageDialog.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpmessagedialog.[ch]: added a simple message
	dialog to avoid code duplication.

	* app/widgets/gimpmessagebox.c: set the border width to 12 pixels.

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c
	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrordialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c
	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c: use the new GimpMessageDialog.

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added menu branch "<Image>/Image/Guides".

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-from-selection.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-new-percent.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-new.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/guides-remove-all.scm: added new
	scripts from Alan Horkan. Fixes bug #119667.

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c: cleaned up and simplified the
	FlareCenter code even more.

	* plug-ins/common/nova.c: did the same changes for the NovaCenter
	stuff.

	Also added code which sets an appropriate cursor on "realize" to
	fix bug #90519, but GimpPreview currently prevents this from
	working correctly...

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]: changed the description for
	GIMP_HELP_BROWSER_GIMP.

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.c:
	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: use a GimpDialog embedding a
	GimpMessageBox instead of gimp_query_boolean_box which looks
	somewhat old fashioned.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: improved error messages on missing help
	browser plug-in.

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.c
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: improved documentation.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c
	(gimp_display_shell_close_dialog): changed button label.

2004-10-12  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/asc2img.scm: Fixed error in name of
	script used in second register line.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: changed rounding.

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/image-new-dialog.c (image_new_response): don't
	forget to reset the template combo on RESPONSE_RESET.

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-foreach.c: keep the container of dirty
	images up to date.

	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c: fixed model/view behavior here, too.

	(both are still far from perfect)

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c
	(gimp_display_shell_close_dialog): keep the time uptodate.

2004-10-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c (gimp_imagefile_create_thumbnail): ref
	the imagefile while creating the thumbnail.

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_auto_thumbnail): moved
	the tricky part about thumbnail creation into the new function
	gimp_imagefile_create_thumbnail_weak().

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pagecurl/pagecurl.c: forgot to remove N_() from
	gimp_plugin_menu_register().

2004-10-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): added
	missing and resolved conflicting mnemonics.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: moved out of the
	"Modify" placeholder. Using placeholders from Script-Fu breaks
	i18n.  We will need to change menu registration for scripts but
	this will have to wait..

2004-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/*/*.c: all plug-ins except script-fu: removed the
	translation marks from the menu paths passed to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register(). All default menu branches used by
	included plug-ins are created and translated by the core now.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: renamed struct member "unit" to
	"resolution_unit".

	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/core/gimp-edit.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-duplicate.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c
	* app/dialogs/info-window.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-export.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox-dnd.c:
	* app/xcf/xcf-load.c
	* app/xcf/xcf-save.c: changed accordingly. Use gimp_image_get_unit()
	where appropriate.

	* app/core/gimptemplate.c (gimp_template_set_from_image): fixed
	unit handling. Don't touch the template unit, it is used as the
	initial display unit. This will need further changes...

2004-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_enum_radio_frame_add):
	need to pack the widget expanding. Fixes pattern container
	entries.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/info-window.[ch]: fixed unit handling. Right-align
	the labels displaying the cursor position. Renamed the "Extended"
	tab to "Cursor". Renamed the API accordingly.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/drawable-commands.c (drawable_rotate_cmd_callback):
	if the drawable is a channel, pass clip_result as FALSE. Need to
	do this here for rotating only because it can't be decided
	generically in GimpChannel. Fixes crash when rotating channels
	or layer masks.

	Use the undo_desc from GimpItemClass instead of passing "Flip
	Layer" and "Rotate Layer".

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-open.c: minor cleanup.

	* app/file/file-save.c (file_save_as): no need to fiddle with the
	image name, the URI is taken from the imagefile anyway.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c (layers_actions_update): set
	"layers-crop" insensitive if the selection is empty.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/alien-glow-button.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/alien-glow-logo.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/basic2-logo.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/gradient-bevel-logo.scm: use "Sans
	Bold" instead of "Futura_Poster". The underscore in the font name
	used to confuse intltool (bug #137029) and the freefont package
	isn't that widely used any longer anyway.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpsizebox.[ch]: added new widget GimpSizeBox.

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: the order of setting the X and Y
	properties does matter.

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/scale-dialog.[ch]: added first version of a new
	Scale dialog in an attempt to address bug #151022.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: use the new scale dialog.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: added mnemonics for the size
	entries.

2004-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_table_attach_aligned):
	instead of simply using the passed widget as mnemonic_widget for
	the GtkLabel, call the new utility function find_mnemonic_widget()
	which recursively searches the passed widget until it finds one
	that actually can be mnemonic-activated. Fixes lots of mnemonics
	where the attached widget is e.g. a GtkEventBox or GtkComboBox.

2004-10-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptooloptions-gui.[ch]: removed the recently added
	utility functions again.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpviewablebox.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: and added cleaned up
	versions here.

	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/dialogs/convert-dialog.c: use gimp_palette_box_new() instead
	of reinventing the wheel.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpaction.c (gimp_action_set_proxy): use a larger
	icon size for GimpImagefile views.

	* themes/Default/images/stock-frame-64.png: removed the 1 pixel
	wide empty border around the frame.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer-frame.c: adjusted the hardcoded values.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: defined DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS with the
	configure options that are needed to run 'make dist'.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: tweaked table spacings to get
	the Height label aligned with the entry again.

2004-10-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpprogressdialog.c (gimp_progress_dialog_new): set
	the "skip_taskbar_hint" and "skip_pager_hint" properties on the
	progress window.

2004-10-11  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/fp/fp.c: Moved from here...

	* plug-ins/common/fp.c: ... to here.

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/common/.cvsignore
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/fp: Removed directory.

2004-10-11  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jigsaw.c: ported to GimpAspectPreview.

2004-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c: use a GimpSizeEntry for specifying
	the flare center. Fixed flare center dragging. Lots of cleanup.

2004-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-types.h: removed ColorDialog typedef.

2004-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptooloptions-gui.[ch]: added utility functions
	which create a GimpViewableButton+GimpContainerEntry combo for
	brushes, patterns, gradients and fonts and a very ugly utility
	function which packs one of these combos into a GtkFrame returned
	by gimp_prop_enum_radio_frame_new(). This stuff does not really
	belong here but is too ugly to be moved to a more general place.

	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c
	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.c: use the new utility functions. Moved
	the pattern previews into the radio frame where using the pattern
	is selected. Make them insensitive if using the pattern is not
	selected.

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h: tweaked the thumbnail related blurbs.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: group the thumbnail related
	controls together. Could probably still be improved...

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/documents-commands.c
	(documents_recreate_preview_cmd_callback): when recreating the
	thumbnail, delete old thumbnails and create it in the configured
	thumbnail size instead of the container view preview size.

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c (gimp_thumbnail_update_thumb):
	reset the image info when the thumbnail state changes.

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: construct a case-insensitive glob
	pattern to use when filtering for file extensions.

2004-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_create_thumbnails):
	user-visible counting starts at 1, not 0.

2004-10-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: added missing contributors.
	Thanks to Kevin Cozens for going through ChangeLog and making a list.

	* AUTHORS
	* app/dialogs/authors.h: regenerated.

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: ooops, forgot to disable the debug
	output again.

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/batch.c: clarified.

2004-10-08  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed duplicate GETTEXT_PACKAGE line.

2004-10-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.[ch]
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb.def: added an API to delete thumbnails.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_create_thumbnail):
	when recreating a thumbnail on user request, delete all existing
	thumbnails for it.

	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap2.c: removed unused variable.

2004-10-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb-utils.[ch]
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumb.def
	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: added support for local thumbnails
	as introduced by version 0.7 of the thumbnail spec. Untested, but
	at least the API is there.

2004-10-10  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap2.c: ported to GimpAspectPreview, and some
	minor cleanups.

2004-10-10  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/vpropagate.c: added a preview.

2004-10-10  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c
	* plug-ins/common/waves.c: cleanups and ported to GimpAspectPreview.

2004-10-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.c (gimp_container_view_lookup):
	handle NULL as viewable parameter as a workaround for bug #149906.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_auto_thumbnail): made
	the code more robust.

	* app/xcf/xcf-private.h
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: added a const qualifier.

2004-10-09  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.h: fixed a typo in the double-inclusion guard.

2004-10-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* AUTHORS
	* app/dialogs/authors.h: regenerated. Someone should look into
	updating the list of contributors for the 2.2 release ...

2004-10-08  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* tools/authorsgen/contributors: Added my name to the
	list of contributors.

2004-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: tweaked the text shown while
	updating the preview so that the dialog doesn't need to resize.

2004-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpcoreconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h: added new gimprc option
	"thumbnail-filesize-limit" that allows to control the maximum
	filesize for automatic thumbnail creation.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: added a GUI for it, needs
	review.

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.[ch]: minor cleanups. Moved call to
	gimp_thumbnail_peek_image() from gimp_imagefile_save_thumb() to
	 gimp_imagefile_save_thumbnail() to avoid it being called twice.

	* app/file/file-utils.[ch]: export utility function
	file_utils_find_proc_by_extension() that allows to check for a
	file plug-in by looking at the filename extension only.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.[ch]: automatically create or update
	thumbnails for image files with a known extension that are smaller
	than "thumbnail-filesize-limit".  Fixes bug #137176.

2004-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/ripple.c: handle the tile parameter identically
	for preview and final result. Set Edges options insensitive when
	"Retain tileability" is checked. Reported by Olivier.

2004-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/apply_lens.c (lens_dialog): invalidate the
	preview when the toggle buttons are used. Reported by Olivier.

	* app/widgets/gimpview.c: minor cleanup.

2004-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c: implement GimpTool::key_press() and
	cancel the tool on GDK_Escape. Come cleanup.

2004-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made the text options about two toolbox grid columns smaller.
	Addresses bug #122862.

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c (gimp_prop_size_entry_new): use
	the number of digits of the property's max_val plus two as number
	of chars for the sizeentry'y spinbutton (instead of always 10 as
	before).

	* app/tools/gimptextoptions.c (gimp_text_options_gui): GtkEntry
	has a minimal width of 150 pixels (eek). Set a silly small minimal
	width instead (the entry expands to the available width anyway).

2004-10-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-utils.c: added lots of const qualifiers.

2004-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c: the gradient button in blend
	options got lost, added it back. Also moved creation of the brush,
	pattern and gradient buttons to utility functions and cleaned up
	the whole file a bit.

2004-10-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_real_scaled)
	(gimp_display_shell_flush)
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_display_create): always pass a
	GimpDisplay, not a GimpDisplayShell as "data" to
	gimp_ui_manager_update().

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_data_get_*): removed checks if the
	passed data is a GimpDisplayShell and temporarily added g_assert()
	to be sure. The assertions will be removed before 2.2.

2004-10-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: added some (disabled) debug output.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer-frame.[ch]: added a way to retrieve
	the size of the frame borders.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: don't set an arbitrary padding but
	exactly the size of the frame borders. Otherwise we get large
	thumbnails (scaled down) if we request normal sized ones.

2004-10-07  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: Changed deprecated
	constant ADD to CHANNEL-OP-ADD.

2004-10-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Merged the gz and bz2 plug-ins into one generic compression
	handler that can be extended by adding entries to a table of
	compressor definitions:

	* configure.in: removed bz2 special casing for win32.

	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c: removed.

	* plug-ins/common/compressor.c: new plug-in.

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/common/.cvsignore
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

2004-10-07  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-commands.c: fill in the formula...  :-)
	untabbified.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c: Micro-Cleanup, untabbified.

2004-10-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c: changed zoom actions to be
	GimpEnumActions using the GimpActionSelectType enum. Enables
	keyboard shortcuts for useless stuff like "zoom out a lot", and
	makes them better accessible for external controllers.

	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: renamed view_zoom_cmd_callback()
	to view_zoom_explicit_cmd_callback(), removed the zoom_in and
	zoom_out callbacks and added a new view_zoom_cmd_callback() for
	the new GimpActionSelectType-based actions. The implementation of
	the new zoom types is questionable but now there is a place where
	nomis can fill in nice formulas...

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.[ch]: added new parameter
	"gboolean propagate_release" to gimp_edit_slection_tool_start()
	and remember it in the GimpEditSelectionTool struct. If requested,
	propagate GimpTool::button_release() to the tool below in the tool
	stack.

	* app/tools/gimpselectiontool.c (gimp_selection_tool_start_edit):
	pass FALSE so we don't get the button_release().

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.[ch]: pass TRUE so we get
	button_release(). If moving a layer or path in "pick active" mode,
	remember the old active layer/path and switch back to it in
	button_release(). Fixes bug #97734.

	Unrelated:

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	(gimp_edit_selection_tool_motion): set "first_move" to FALSE only
	if a move actually happened. Fixes un-undoable moves at high zoom
	factors.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c (gimp_dnd_data_drag_begin): remember for
	which GdkDragContext the icon_widget was made.

	(gimp_dnd_data_drag_end): destroy the icon_widget only if it was
	created for this GdkDragContext. Fixes broken DND icon_widgets
	when dragging the same source again while the old icon_widget is
	still floating back from an unsuccessful drop. Fixes bug #139337.

2004-10-05  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: Slight cleanup of doc generating code.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: for deprecated procedures, create a gtk-doc
	comment that contains a link to the replacement procedure and
	doesn't contain redundant information.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: fixed names of replacement
	procedures.

	* libgimp/gimpbrushes.c
	* libgimp/gimpgradients.c
	* libgimp/gimppalettes.c
	* libgimp/gimppatterns.c: made the handwritten gtk-doc comments of
	deprecated procedures look like the generated ones.

	* app/pdb/text_tool_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpbrushes_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimpgradients_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimppalettes_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimppatterns_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimptexttool_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimp-tools.c (gimp_tools_restore): reset the tool
	options before deserializing so they have the correct default
	values. Fixes bug #120832.

	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpmagnifyoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpselectionoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: removed all set_defaults()
	utility functions and moved their code to reset(). The change
	above calls them automatically so there is no need to call them
	from the GUI constructors any more.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: use a
	scale_entry instead of a spinbutton, changed mnemonic from "R" to
	"E", indentation.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/test-sphere.scm: s/SF_BRUSH/SF-BRUSH/
	in a comment.

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/selection-round.scm: applied patch by
	Alan Horkan that improves usability and usefulness of this script.
	Did some code cleanup and added the old procedure for backward
	compatibility. Fixes bug #145147.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: renamed placeholder in Image->Select
	from "Outline" to "Modify".

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c (ps_open): tweaked error message.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.h (struct ProcRecord): changed new member
	"deprecated" from "gboolean" to a "gchar*" which holds the name of
	the replacement procedure.

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: changed accordingly.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_run): show
	the name of the replacement procedure in the warning message.

	* tools/pdbgen/stddefs.pdb: added utility function
	std_pdb_deprecated() which takes the name of the replacement
	procedure and fills the blurb, help, author, copyright, date and
	deprecated fields of the procedure definition.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/palettes.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: use it instead of duplicating
	the same code and strings for all deprecated procedures.

	* app/pdb/*_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimppatterns_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimptexttool_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fixed the scale constraints radio buttons:

	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c (gimp_transform_options_gui):
	initialize the radio group with the correct value instead of
	resetting the model before creating the group.

	(gimp_scale_options_constrain_callback): change the model
	only if the radio button became active.

	(gimp_scale_options_constrain_notify): new callback which makes
	the radio buttons a real view on the model again (fixes GUI
	updates on modifier press/release).

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c (plug_in_actions_update): an image
	doesn't necessarily have a drawable. Handle the case when it doesn't.

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.[ch]
	* app/batch.[ch]
	* app/main.c: added new command-line option "--batch-interpreter"
	that allows to specify the procedure to use to process batch
	commands. Removed the perl-server hack but kept Script-Fu as the
	default for backward compatibility.

	* docs/gimp.1.in: documented the new option.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c (file_revert_confirm_callback):
	removed the code which sets the new image on all contexts where
	the old image was set...

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-foreach.c (gimp_displays_reconnect):
	...and added it here so it happens for all calls of this function,
	also from the PDB. Fixes bug #154638.

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: updated.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: added $deprecated = 1 to deprecated
	functions even if they are not exported to libgimp any more.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.h (struct ProcRecord): added member
	"gboolean deprecated".

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: fill it accordingly.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_run): warn
	not only for deprecated procedured which are in the compat hach
	table, but also for procedures with deprecated flag set to TRUE.

	* app/pdb/*_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpbrush_pdb.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppattern_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* libgimp/gimpbrushmenu.c

	are more args after it.

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 2.1.7.

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-10-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: store the time when the image is first
	dirtied.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: tell the user what time
	period of changes will be lost when the image is not saved.

2004-10-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb (brushes_get_brush_data)
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb (gradients_sample_uniform)
	(gradients_sample_custom) (gradients_get_gradient_data)
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb (patterns_get_pattern_data):

	* app/pdb/brushes_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/gradient_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/gradients_cmds.c

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_table_attach_aligned):
	left-justify the label.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpdialog.c: if a button with GTK_RESPONSE_HELP
	is being added, hide the automatically added help button.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c: five buttons are too
	much for the action area. Renamed the About button to Help and
	resurrected the help button in the about dialog as a way to get to
	the actual help pages (pressing F1 will get you there as well).

2004-10-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: added a help button.

2004-10-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c (marshall_proc_db_call):
	- check the number of elements of array parameters against
	  the actually passed array and spit a proper error message
	  instead of trashing the wire. Fixes bug #154266.
	- g_strdup()/g_free() the proc_name so it doesn't get mungled
	  by convert_string().
	- added missing implementation of INT16ARRAY return values.
	- cleaned up STRINGARRAY value implementations to work like
	  all other array values.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_reset):
	fixed reset for SF_TEXT values.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_interface):
	oops, didn't meant to remove that line.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/Makefile.am (imagemap_SOURCES): removed pix-data.h.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	take drawable offsets into account when masking the preview with
	the selection mask.

2004-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimprc.pdb (gimprc_query, gimprc_set): disallow
	the empty string as token. Spotted by Kevin Cozens.

	* app/pdb/gimprc_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpaspectpreview.c (gimp_aspect_preview_draw_buffer):
	no need to set bpp before calling gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail_data().

2004-10-04  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpaspectpreview.c: (gimp_aspect_preview_draw_buffer):
	only apply the effect inside the current selection. This, together
	with my previous commit fixes bug #132194.

2004-10-04  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c: Ported to GimpAspectPreview. This
	addresses but not totally fixes bug #132194.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h: added gimprc option "show-help-button".

	to the gimprc settings.

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_about): set 
	the help_func again (but not the help_id).

2004-10-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_about):
	enabled line wrapping on labels.
	(script_fu_interface): substitute underscores by hyphens to
	generate the help-id from the procedure name.

2004-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimpwire.c: added assertions to make sure "count" is
	always >= 0. Turns the crash described in bug #154266 into a
	warning plus corrupted wire state :) Real fix (in script-fu) will
	follow. Untabified.

2004-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimphelpui.c: untabified.

	(gimp_help_callback): use GIMP_HELP_ID instead of "gimp-help-id".

2004-10-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brush.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/palette.pdb: disallow the empty string for
	new brushes, gradients and palettes and check the return value
	of gimp_data_factory_data_new(). Cleanup.

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c (gimp_brush_generated_new)
	* app/core/gimpgradient.c (gimp_gradient_new)
	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c (gimp_data_factory_data_new): same
	here. Fixes bug #154264.

	* app/core/gimpdata.[ch] (gimp_data_set_filename): added boolean
	"deletable" parameter because it's not derivable from "writable".

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c (gimp_data_factory_load_data): need
	to figure "deletable" separately from "writable" to be able to
	delete unsavable stuff in the user-writable data directories.
	Fixes bug #154410.

	(gimp_data_factory_data_save_single): cleaned up.

	* app/pdb/brush_cmds.c

	padding for the shadow frame to avoid scaling the thumbnail.

2004-09-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* themes/Default/images/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/stock-frame-64.png: added a stock icon
	that shows a simple drop shadow but could be exchanged for other
	image decorations.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.[ch]: register the new icon.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer-frame.[ch]: new file that holds some
	ugly code to draw a frame around a preview pixbuf.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.[ch]: the frame pixbuf is attached
	to the GimpViewRenderer class so it can be shared by all renderers.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererimagefile.c: use the new functionality
	to draw a nice frame around imagefile previews.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerbox.c: draw imagefile preview w/o a border.

2004-09-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/data-commands.c: cleanup.

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paint_tools.pdb: removed unused #includes.

	* app/text/gimptext-xlfd.c
	* app/text/gimptext.c
	* app/text/gimptextlayer-xcf.c: include "text-types.h" instead
	of "text/text-types.h".

	* app/widgets/gimppatternselect.c: create a GimpPatternFactoryView
	instead of GimpDataFactoryView.

	* app/pdb/paint_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-09-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/brushes-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradients-actions.c
	* app/actions/palettes-actions.c
	* app/actions/patterns-actions.c: made the "foo-edit" actions
	GimpStringActions and pass the identifier of the editor dialog
	to the callback.

	* app/actions/data-commands.[ch] (data_edit_data_cmd_callback):
	show the editor dialog here instead of calling view->edit_func().

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: removed the brush,
	gradient and palette edit_funcs.

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: removed typedef GimpDataEditFunc.

	* app/widgets/gimpdatafactoryview.[ch]: removed the edit_func
	member and parameters and create the edit button unconditionally.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrushfactoryview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppatternfactoryview.[ch]: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpdataselect.[ch]: removed this class, it's not
	needed any longer.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrushselect.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpgradientselect.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteselect.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppatternselect.[ch]: derive them from GimpPdbDialog
	and follow the edit_func removal.

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c (gui_pdb_dialog_new): removed edit_func
	stuff.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c: minor unrelated cleanup.

2004-09-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constrcutors.[ch]: renamed some constructors
	for consistency and added a (useless) template grid.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c: make the arrays of GimpDialogFactoryEntries
	more readable by using macros to define them.

2004-09-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c: removed conversion to TempBuf.
	Instead implement GimpViewable::get_new_pixbuf by compositing the
	thumbnail on a checkerboard.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.[ch]: renamed the no_view_pixbuf
	struct member to pixbuf.
	(gimp_view_renderer_real_render): try gimp_viewable_get_pixbuf()
	and render the pixbuf before falling back to the TempBuf preview.
	(gimp_view_renderer_render_pixbuf): new function that sets a
	pixbuf for the renderer and flushes the render_buffer.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererimagefile.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_imagefile_render): render the pixbuf.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.c: create the document history
	dockable with a zero borderwidth.

2004-09-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb (file_load_thumbnail_invoker): use
	the GIMP_CHECK_SIZE_SM define, not the enum value
	GIMP_CHECK_SIZE_SMALL_CHECKS which is 0 (eeek!).

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help_get_locales): minor cleanup.

2004-09-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdataeditor.[ch]: added "data" property.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c: pass the current data to
	g_object_new() so we never end up with initially empty editors.

2004-09-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdataeditor.[ch]: added CONSTRUCT_ONLY
	"data-factory" property. Removed gimp_data_editor_construct().

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c: pass the construct parameters
	to g_object_new().

2004-09-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolorframe.c: changed label alignment to be more
	HIG conformant and consistent with the rest of the user interface.

2004-09-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: added "name", "blurb",
	"stock_id" and "help_id" to struct GimpDialogFactoryEntry and to
	gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_register(). Added typedef
	GimpDialogConstructor which takes a GimpDialogFactoryEntry in
	addition to the parameters GimpDialogNewFunc takes. Added a
	constructor function pointer to GimpDialogFactory which defaults
	to a function that just returns entry->new_func(). Use that
	constructor instead of entry->new_func() for creating
	dialogs. Added public API gimp_dialog_factory_set_constructor().

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c: register name, blurb, stock_id and
	help_id for all dockables so all the dialog info lives in one huge
	ugly table now. For the global_toolbox_factory and the
	global_dock_factory, set a constructor which creates a dockable
	around the widget returned by entry->new_func().

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: don't create the dockable
	in each dialog constructor. Removes tons of code and reduces most
	constructors to a "return gimp_foo_new(...)" one-liner. Got rid of
	all static variables, they were from a time when GimpDialogFactory
	was unable to manage singletons.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.[ch]: return GtkWidget, not
	GimpDataEditor from gimp_foo_editor_new().

	* app/widgets/gimpdataeditor.c: minor cleanups.

2004-09-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolordialog.c: moved stuff from new() to init().

2004-09-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Ported GimpNavigationView to use actions for its buttons:

	* app/menus/menus.c (menus_init): register a <GimpNavigationEditor>
	UI manager containing the "view" action group.

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_data_get_foo): handle "data" being
	a GimpNavigationEditor.

	* app/actions/view-actions.c (view_actions): added tooltips for
	the actions used in the editor.

	(view_actions_update): use action_data_get_display() instead of
	checking the type of "data" manually.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.c (gimp_editor_add_action_button): use
	a GtkToggleButton instead of GimpButton for GtkToggleActions.

	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.[ch]: added a GimpMenuFactory
	parameter to the public constructor and removed all other
	parameters. Simplified gimp_navigation_editor_new_private() and
	use gimp_editor_add_action_button() instead of just add_button()
	for creating the buttons. Made gimp_navigation_view_set_shell()
	private. Update the UI manager when the shell zooms or scrolls.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.c (dialogs_navigation_view_new):
	pass the menu_factory to gimp_navigation_editor_new().

	Removed #includes which are not needed any more.

2004-09-26  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/exchange.c: use the same preview as in all other
	plug-ins.

2004-09-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_stock.c: removed C++ style comment.

2004-09-25  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_stock.[ch]
	* plug-ins/imagemap/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/imagemap/*.xpm: get rid of all .xpm images

	* configure.in 
	* plug-ins/imagemap/images/*: and add them as .png here

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_browse.c: remove unused include.
	
2004-09-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.h: removed trailing whitespace.

2004-09-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: changed mnemonic so that
	you can close an image w/o saving it by using Ctrl-W Alt-W.

2004-09-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-qmask.h: added comment about not changing the
	silly "Qmask" string because it is used to identify the Quick Mask
	in the XCF.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c: implement GimpViewable::get_description()
	and return "Quick Mask" if it's the Quick Mask.

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c
	* app/actions/qmask-commands.c
	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpimage-qmask.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: s/QuickMask/Quick Mask/.

2004-09-25  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/engrave.c: Added a preview and #if'ed out some
	unreachable code.

2004-09-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppickable.[ch]: added new vitrual function
	GimpPickableInterface::get_image()

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c
	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c
	* app/core/gimpprojection.[ch]: implement it.

2004-09-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.[ch]: removed redundant "gimage"
	parameters from public constructors. They are all GimpImageEditor
	widgets which get their image via gimp_docked_set_context() and
	gimp_image_editor_set_image() later anyway. Fixes uglyness as well
	as problems where the editors had an image but no context, causing
	strange behavior in their foo_actions_update() functions.

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.c: changed accordingly. Removed
	redundant calls to gimp_dockable_set_context() on newly created
	dockables because they will get a context when added to their
	containers.

2004-09-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c: moved stuff from
	gimp_colormap_editor_new() to
	gimp_colormap_editor_init(). Untabified.

2004-09-25  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: made the preview behave like in all other
	plug-ins by using a GimpDrawablePreview.  This allowed to remove a
	bunch of complicated code.

2004-09-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.[ch]: added resolution and image
	type information which is usually hidden in the Advanced Options.

2004-09-25  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/oilify.c: Added a preview and made some small
	cleanups.

2004-09-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h (LAYER_PREVIEW_SIZE_BLURB): try to
	improve the tooltip for the layer-preview-size gimprc setting.
	Addresses bug #153603.

2004-09-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_fs_to_layer): factored
	common code out of the UNDO amd REDO cases. Use gimp_drawable_update()
	instead of gimp_viewable_invalidate_preview() so the projection
	gets updated correctly. Fixes bug #149558.

	* app/core/gimplayer-floating-sel.c (floating_sel_to_layer):
	removed unused variables and their assignments.

2004-09-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.[ch]: added a label that shows
	the pixel size (as in the initial mockup done by Jimmac).

2004-09-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c
	(gimp_image_map_tool_settings_dialog): set the folder using
	gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder(), not set_filename().

2004-09-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/base/curves.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: defined CURVES_NUM_POINTS and use it.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb (curves_spline_invoker): unset the
	last control point which got initialized to (255,255) by
	curves_init(). Fixes bug #153635.

	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-09-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c: removed a linebreak from a
	warning message.

	* app/tools/gimpvectoroptions.c: code cleanup: untabified and
	trailing whitespace removal, removed empty instance_init()
	funcions, cleaned up variable declarations/initializations.

2004-09-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpairbrushtool.c (gimp_airbrush_tool_register)
	* app/tools/gimppenciltool.c (gimp_pencil_tool_register):
	add GIMP_CONTEXT_GRADIENT_MASK to the tools' context_props because
	these tools use the current gradient. Fixes bug #153584.

2004-09-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/color-dialog.[ch]: removed...

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am

	a whole bunch of ugly widgets/ -> dialogs/ dependencies.

2004-09-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c: put the text view into
	a scrolled window. Removed "changed" callbacks for GtkEntry and
	GtkTextView. Instead retrieve the final string when the dialog is
	confirmed.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/carved-logo.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/chrome-it.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/crystal-logo.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/sota-chrome-logo.scm: use
	gimp-data-directory instead of the deprecated constant
	gimp-data-dir.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/mkbrush.scm: unmarked strings for
	translation that I marked yesterday. Won't work unfortunately.

2004-09-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/blended-logo.scm: fixed context
	push/pop.

	parameter.

2004-09-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixbuf.c (gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail,
	gimp_image_get_thumbnail): use the exported symbols from
	libgimp, not the private _gimp_drawable_thumbnail()
	and _gimp_image_thumbnail() functions.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added new symbols, removed
	_gimp_image_thumbnail and _gimp_drawable_thumbnail.

2004-09-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/brushes.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/palettes.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/patterns.pdb: removed the foos_set_foo()
	procedures and marked the foos_get_foo() ones as deprecated. For
	brushes, patterns and palettes, added foos_get_foo_info()
	procedures which work like foos_get_foo_data() but return just the
	properties, not the actual data. Allow NULL or "" to be passed
	as name to all functions (use the current brush, pattern etc.
	in this case).

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fonts.pdb: cleanup.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: added the removed ones to the compat
	hash table.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpbrushes.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpgradients.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppalettes.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppatterns.[ch]: new files with compat functions
	wich call the resp. gimp_context_*() functions.

	* libgimp/gimp.h: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/brushes_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/gradients_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c

2004-09-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c (bumpmap_dialog): added a GtkPaned for
	packing preview and controls so the controls are resizable again.

2004-09-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/hsv-graph.scm: 

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/context.pdb: oops, should probably pop, not
	push a context in gimp_context_pop().

	* app/pdb/context_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/mkbrush.scm: don't fiddle with the
	brush description, simply use the name choosen by the user.

2004-09-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Converted the next bunch of scripts to the new context API:

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/[d-n]*.scm: push and pop a context.
	Removed code that used to restore the context values changed by
	the scripts.

2004-09-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_return_priv):
	removed warning about entering a dead code path. That path is not
	dead at all :)

	so the views can update accordingly.

	* app/core/gimpselection.c: s/"Selection"/"Floated Layer"/.

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c:

	contains the ProcRecord, the proc's GMainLoop and its return
	values.

	Use the same struct for the plug-in's main proc and its
	temp_procs, so we finally have one set of return values per call
	frame, and not just one per plug-in.

	Added plug_in_proc_frame_push()/pop() and changed
	plug_in_main_loop[_quit]() accordingly.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c: changed accordingly.

	from the header frame, use a smaller font for the subtitle,
	removed the separator.

	* app/dialogs/preferences-dialog.c: removed the prelit event box
	from the header frame. Perhaps we should have subtitles here with

	* app/actions/file-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.[ch]: added "file-open-as-layer"
	action and callback. Abuse the "gimage" field of GimpFileDialog to
	indicate layer opening (it's otherwise unused for file-open).

	open the selected files as layers for that image.

2004-09-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselect.c (gimp_color_select_xy_events):
	removed "case GDK_CONFIGURE" because it's not needed and did

	GtkRadioAction callback but behaved like a GtkToggleAction
	callback. Fixes bug #152948.

2004-09-19  DindinX  <dindinx@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: use a GimpDrawablePreview instead of a

	"Floating Selection" as the name for a floating selection.

	* app/core/gimpscanconvert.c (VALUE_TO_PIXEL): replaced a bitshift
	with a binary and. Should be unnoticeably faster ;)

2004-09-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: removed #if 0'ed code, took assignments
	out of if()-conditions, minor cleanup.

2004-09-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpscanconvert.c: Implemented an own rendering
	callback for libart and use it instead of art_gray_svp_aa().
	This now handles non-antialiased scan conversions itself. It
	also basically shows the way to implement a LUT for the
	scan conversion.

2004-09-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c: removed code that isn't needed any
	longer now that the dialog is a singleton.

2004-09-15  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: fix the preview for the zoom blur mode.

2004-09-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c
	(gimp_preview_area_[draw|blend|mask]): fixed code that handles
	drawing outside of the preview area.

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c (preview_update): draw the preview
	directly from the pixel region.

2004-09-15  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: use guint16 instead of __u16.
	Should fix bug #152746.

2004-09-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimpui.def: renamed gimp_drawable_preview_draw() to
	gimp_drawable_preview_draw_buffer() and added a rowstride
	parameter. Added new functions gimp_drawable_preview_get_drawable()
	and gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region().

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: added a preview that uses the
	shadow tiles as the preview buffer and draws using the new
	gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region() API.

	* plug-ins/common/photocopy.c
	* plug-ins/common/softglow.c: use gimp_drawable_preview_draw_region().

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c
	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c
	* plug-ins/common/edge.c
	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c
	* plug-ins/common/grid.c

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c
	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c
	* plug-ins/common/sharpen.c
	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c
	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/struc.c
	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c
	* plug-ins/common/wind.c: use gimp_drawable_preview_draw_buffer().

2004-09-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added help IDs for the drawable- and
	vectors-visible and -liked actions as well as for the layer mask
	property action.

	* app/actions/drawable-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c: use them.

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: ditto. Use
	GIMP_STOCK_TRANSPARENCY for all layer opacity actions. Replaced
	"paint_mode" by "mode" in all action and function/variable names
	because this is the layer mode, not a paint mode.

	* app/actions/channels-commands.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c: set the "activates-default"
	property on the name entry in all "New Foo" and "Edit Foo
	Attributes" dialogs except in the "New Layer" dialog.
	Addresses bug #148026.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added a (commented out) layer
	properties menu containing all the new actions.

2004-09-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: added actions and callbacks
	"layers-preserve-transparency" and
	"layers-paint-mode-first,last,previous,next". Update the "active"
	state of the recently added layer mask property actions in
	layers_actions_update().

	* app/actions/drawable-actions.c
	* app/actions/drawable-commands.[ch]: added actions and callbacks
	for "drawable-visible" and "drawable-linked". Fixes bug #152597.

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: same here ("vectors-visible"
	and "vectors-linked").

	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	(gimp_layer_tree_view_preserve_button_toggled): flush the image
	so the new actions are updated. Compress preserve_trans undos.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added the layer mask property actions
	to the Layers/Mask submenu.

	* menus/layers-menu.xml: reordered the mask property actions
	to have the same order as in the image menu.

2004-09-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_menu_position): improved the fix for bug
	#152662 and removed trailing whitespace.

2004-09-15  Nathan Summers  <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_menu_position): clamp the popup menu's Y
	position to the visible area of the GtkTreeView.  Fixes #152662.

2004-09-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpquerybox.c: set the "activates-default"
	property on the entries in all query boxes so hitting "return"
	confirms them. Addresses bug #148026.

2004-09-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpbufferview.c: simplified the code which deals
	with the global_buffer's preview. The new buffer view renderer
	does the aspect ratio magic all by itself now.

	* app/actions/image-commands.h: removed trailing whitespace.

2004-09-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererbuffer.[ch]: added a view renderer
	which knows how to preserve a GimpBuffer's aspect ratio if the
	view's aspect ratio is different.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer-utils.c
	(gimp_view_renderer_type_from_viewable_type): use it for viewables
	of type GimpBuffer. Fixes bug #152531

2004-09-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/flarefx.c
	* plug-ins/common/nova.c: embed the preview into a sunken frame
	and put it into the upper left corner of the dialog.

2004-09-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.[ch]
	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c
	* app/gui/gui.c: let the dialog factory handle the quit dialog
	as singleton. Fixes bug #151914.

	* app/dialogs/quit-dialog.c: added a warning here. We need a
	container of dirty images for the above change to work correctly.

2004-09-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (save_dialog): make the "Save EXIF data"
	toggle insensitive when no EXIF data is present (bug #140042).

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-close.c: as suggested by the HIG,
	ask the user to save the image when the last display is being
	closed. Addresses some issues raised in bug #106726.

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.c (app_run): install the message handler for the
	"Gimp-Dialogs" domain.

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: resurrected file_open_dialog_show()
	and file_save_dialog_show() as private utility functions to get
	rid of code duplication.

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Manage the file-save dialog using the dialog factory and stop
	making menu items insensitive while it is open. Fixes bug #81407.

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/file-dialog-utils.[ch]: removed these files.

	* app/dialogs/file-save-dialog.[ch]: removed functions
	file_save_dialog_show() and file_save_a_copy_dialog_show() and
	changed internal function file_save_dialog_create() to
	file_save_dialog_new().

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c
	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: made it completely
	managed by the dialog factory.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: create it using the dialog
	factory. Attach it to the image so we open only one save
	dialog per image.

	* app/dialogs/file-open-dialog.c: added precondition checks
	to file_open_dialog_new().

2004-09-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: some code cleanup.

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/dialogs/file-open-dialog.[ch]: removed function
	file_open_dialog_show() and changed internal function
	file_open_dialog_create() to file_open_dialog_new().

	* app/dialogs/dialogs.c
	* app/dialogs/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: made it completely
	managed by the dialog factory.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: create it using the dialog factory.

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in
	* app/Makefile.am: added new directory app/dialogs and link
	libappdialogs.c into the gimp binary.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/gui-types.h
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c

	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.[ch]: removed these files...

	* app/dialogs/Makefile.am
	* app/dialogs/dialogs-types.h

	* app/dialogs/*.[ch]: ...and added them here. Changed some
	filenames like module-browser -> module-dialog.

	* app/app_procs.c

2004-09-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Restore binary compatibility of the wire protocol that was
	broken by the recent GPConfig changes:

	* libgimpbase/gimpprotocol.[ch] (struct _GPConfig)
	(_gp_config_read)
	(_gp_config_write): argh, we can't use the two bytes padding
	because that's just a binary compatible struct change, but inserts
	two bytes into the byte stream that goes over the wire. Use the
	first two bytes of the former "gdouble gamma" instead.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c (plug_in_run)
	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_config): changed accordingly.

2004-09-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: simulate the behaviour of GNU gettext and
	look at the LANGUAGE environment variable if the locale is not "C".

2004-09-13  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Fix trailing whitespace introduced by me.
	/me hides embarrassed in a corner...   :)

2004-09-13  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Fix warnings and coding style.

2004-09-12  Nathan Summers  <rock@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: disable crop and resize buttons while the
	operation is being processed.  Fixes #152372.

2004-09-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/aa.c (aa_dialog): use a combo box for format
	selection.

2004-09-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: fixed gtk-doc comments, removed trailing
	whitespace.

2004-09-12  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: some more fixes by nomis.

2004-09-12  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: nomis helped me to make some correction to
	the documentation.

2004-09-12  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: more documentation.

2004-09-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c: added a default value (TRUE) for the
	update_preview toggle.

	* plug-ins/common/wind.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea, so the preview is
	much more useful now.

2004-09-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixelrgn.c: added some gtk-doc documentation to pixel
	region related functions. (work in progress)

2004-09-11  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: Added boolean parameter to
	gimp_dialog_factories_toggle to make it possible to ensure a visible
	toolbox.

	* app/actions/dialogs-commands.c: Use the new parameter to ensure
	toolbox visibility after the last image window closes.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Changed accordingly.

	Fixes bug #137057 (the discussion is in bug #152285)

2004-09-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea. 100 less lines of
	code and much more features!

2004-09-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/oilify.c: some code cleanup and small optimisations.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/xpm.c (query): fixed spelling.

2004-09-10  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

2004-09-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselect.c: untabified, removed useless
	inclusion of <gdk/gdkkeysyms.h>.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselect.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea.
	Destroy the GdkGC in unrealize() instead of in finalize().

2004-09-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_drop_status): always call
	gdk_drag_status() before returning FALSE.

	(gimp_container_tree_view_drag_motion): never return FALSE, an
	impossible drop location is now reported by calling
	gdk_drag_status() above. Always returning TRUE makes sure
	gimp_container_tree_view_drag_leave() is called unconditionally
	and can remove the scroll_timeout set in drag_motion().

	Fixes bug #152193 and many other obscure DND crashes caused by the
	scroll_timeout being invoked after the widget is destroyed.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/xpm.c: improved PDB blurb and help. Very loosely
	based on a patch attached to bug #151912.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw_thumb):
	also handle GRAY and GRAYA thumbnails.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb: corrected documentation for
	_gimp_drawable_thumbnail() and _gimp_image_thumbnail().

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.c
	* libgimp/gimpimage_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: fixed positioning of the
	navigation marker and handling of motion events.

2004-09-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: documented new functions.

2004-09-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: added a navigation popup
	similar to the one in the image window. Needs some more work.

2004-09-09  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: added a utility function
	gimp_preview_area_queue_draw(), which queue the right part of the
	preview to be redrawn. And use it in all the drawing functions. This
	fix a problem where the preview wasn't updated correctly after a
	resize.

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c
	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c
	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c

	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/struc.c
	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: pack all drawable previews expanding.
	Also did some general cleanups like consistently naming the dialog
	variable "dialog" and the main vbox "main_vbox".

2004-09-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: right-align the preview for RTL
	layouts.

2004-09-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: allow to set a maximum size
	and center the preview area if its allocation extends the maximum.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: derive from GtkVBox, moved the
	toggle button out of the table and put the table into an aspect
	frame. Added an API to set the preview boundaries. Set the maximum
	size of the GimpPreviewArea from that function.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added new entries.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c: use gimp_preview_set_bounds().

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c: pack the preview widget so that it
	resizes with the dialog.

2004-09-09  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c (gimp_preview_area_blend)
	(gimp_preview_area_mask): optimized the case where both buffers have
	the same alpha for a given pixel.

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererbrush.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererdrawable.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderergradient.c

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererimagefile.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererlayer.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderervectors.c: purely cosmetic cleanup.

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppdbdialog.c (gimp_pdb_dialog_constructor): use
	g_type_name(dialog_type) instead of just "pdb dialog" as name for
	the dialog's private context.

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/convert-dialog.[ch] (convert_dialog_new): changed
	GimpDisplay* parameter to GimpProgress* because that's what it's
	used for.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c (image_convert_cmd_callback):
	changed accordingly.

	* app/gui/convert-dialog.c: massively cleaned up internals. Use a
	GimpViewableButton + GimpContainerEntry combo as in text options
	for selecting the custom palette. Use a filtered container which
	contains only palettes with a maximum of 256 colors.
	Fixes bug #136574

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.[ch]: changed
	file_open_location_dialog_show() to
	file_open_location_dialog_new() and return the dialog.

	* app/gui/dialogs.c
	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.[ch]: added a constructor for it
	and let the dialog factory manage it entirely.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c
	(file_open_location_dialog_cmd_callback): use the dialog factory
	to create it.

2004-09-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c
	(gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_new_internal): renamed parameter
	"gboolean raise_if_found" to "return_existing" and added
	additional parameter "gboolean present".

	(gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_new)
	(gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_raise)
	(gimp_dialog_factory_dockable_new): pass both parameters (passing
	"present" as "raise_if_found" was not quite correct).

2004-09-08  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: fixed a stupid typo.

2004-09-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Reduced indentation level by closing a switch earlier.

2004-09-08  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: (gimp_preview_area_blend)
	use gimp_preview_area_draw when the opacity is 0 or 255, instead of
	duplicating code.

2004-09-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added new entries.

	* libgimpwidgets/test-preview-area.c: fit output into 80 columns.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw): some
	code cleanup.

2004-09-07  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/test-preview-area.c: added some tests for
	gimp_preview_area_blend() and gimp_preview_area_mask().

2004-09-07  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.h: added two functions:
	gimp_preview_area_blend() to draw the blending of two buffers with
	an opacity parameter, and gimp_preview_area_mask() to draw the
	blending of two buffers, with a mask buffer. The code still needs some
	polish, though.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.h: use gimp_preview_area_mask() in
	gimp_drawable_preview_draw(), so the previews are now much more
	accurate (respecting the selection, if any).

	Also made the buf parameter of gimp_drawable_preview_draw() a pointer
	to constants.

2004-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.c
	(gimp_display_shell_draw_grid): #define the constant crosshair
	size for the INTERSECTION grid style instead of using an eeky
	"const gint".

2004-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/dialogs.c (toplevel_entries): added a foreign entry
	"gimp-file-open-loaction-dialog".

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c: register the dialog
	with the toplevel dialog factory so it remembers its position.

2004-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: applied a heavily modified
	patch from David Gowers which adds actions to modify the context's
	paint_mode. Fixes bug #151471.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added them to the (commentd out)
	"Context" submenu.

2004-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c: indentation and whitespace cleanup.

2004-09-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_uri):
	simplified the code that selects an image file by its URI.

2004-09-07  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrendererbrush.c: Added an indicator for
	generated brushes. Pretty straightforward, suggestions for
	improvements are welcome.

2004-09-06  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/struc.c: added a preview.

2004-09-06  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: reordered info_dialog_hide() and
	crop_tool_crop_image(), which avoids the repeated popping up
	of the info dialog and avoids a crash.

	Fixes bug #151712

2004-09-05  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c: use gimp_preview_invalidate() where
	appropriate.

	* plug-ins/common/photocopy.c: Added a preview.

2004-09-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 2.1.5.

2004-09-05  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c: Added a preview.

2004-09-05  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/autocrop.c: fix handling of layers with an
	offset. Resize the image before cropping when the covered area
	of a layer is partially outside the image area. Make math more
	comprehensible.

2004-09-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/convmatrix.c
	* plug-ins/common/smooth_palette.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c: renamed functions from doit() to
	something less silly.

2004-09-04  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: Changed the way we attach the preview
	area frame to the table so very small drawables don't cause a
	malicious bug.

2004-09-04  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c: ported to GimpDrawablePreview.

2004-09-04  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: use the new function.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_set_drawable):
	take care of setting the colormap for indexed drawables.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_area_event): pan with
	the first mouse button only. We will need the other buttons.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: ported to GimpDrawablePreview.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-09-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdevicestatus.c: removed "Configure input
	devices" button. Fixes bug #150177.

2004-09-03  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	that implements a "Comments" tab in the image info dialog.

	Fixes bug #151719.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c (CHECK_COLOR): swapped light
	and gray checks to get a checkerboard that matches the image window.

2004-09-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimpprotocol.h (struct _GPConfig): replaced the
	never used "gdouble gamma" with 8 reserved gint8 and stuffed two
	gint8 behind "gint8 show_tool_tips" where they fit in in a binary
	compatible way due to 32bit aligning of the following "gint32
	min_colors". Use the latter ones for "check_size" and
	"check_type".

	* libgimpbase/gimpprotocol.c (_gp_config_read,write): changed
	accordingly to pass the new stuff over the wire.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c: ditto. Pass the transpareny values
	from GimpDisplayConfig to plug-ins.

	* libgimp/gimp.[ch] (gimp_config): remember the new config values.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimpchecks.h
	* libgimpbase/gimplimits.h: moved check size and check color
	defines. It makes a lot more sense to keep them in gimpchecks.h.

	* libgimpbase/gimpchecks.c (gimp_checks_get_shades): documented.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c (gimp_drawable_preview_draw):
	added a sanity check so we don't crash if the drawable pointer
	should ever be NULL here.

2004-09-02  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-*test.c: a regression test now
	iterates over 8388625 pixels per pass.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.c:
	Ensured that a clobbered condition code register is reflected in
	the clobbered register list for each asm() statement.
	This should FIX bug #147013.

2004-09-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/Makefile.am
	* libgimpbase/gimpchecks.[ch] added gimp_checks_get_shades().

	* app/base/temp-buf.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-render.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: use the new function instead
	of replicating these numbers in three different places.

2004-09-03  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/*.c: made the code much more readable by
	applying the gimp's coding standard (intentation, space, etc.), and
	remove the GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED warnings, since these files don't use
	any deprecated stuff anymore.

2004-09-02  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimpui.def
	* libgimpbase/gimpbase.def

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c
	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c
	* plug-ins/common/softglow.c
	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: fixed various coding style and naming
	issues and added some missing signal connections to update the new
	previews.

2004-09-02  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c: don't assume the preview has always the
	same size, and do the memory allocation in preview_update(). As a side
	effect, this fix a segfault :-).  Also save the preview toggle state
	between invocations.

2004-09-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-render.c (check_combos): light and
	dark check color were swapped for GIMP_CHECK_TYPE_GRAY_CHECKS.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: added "check-size" and
	"check-type" properties and draw the checkerboard accordingly.

2004-09-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c (script_fu_ok)
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_script_proc):
	use a GString for assembling the commands string instead of
	g_sprintf()ing into a buffer. Removes the need for a separate loop
	over all args to determine the buffer's length and makes the
	remaining code smaller and more readable.

2004-09-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: made gimp_preview_draw() public,
	added some gtk-doc comments.
	(gimp_preview_toggle_callback): immidiately invalidate the preview.

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (gauss): fixed (and simplified) handling
	of zero radii by using the new GimpPreview API.

2004-09-01  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx.[ch]: Added
	gimp_composite_addition_va8_va8_va8_mmx().

	* plug-ins/common/checkerboard.c
	* plug-ins/common/diffraction.c
	* plug-ins/common/illusion.c
	* plug-ins/common/polar.c
	* plug-ins/common/ripple.c
	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/video.c: don't pass run_mode to
	gimp_rgn_iterator_new(), it's unused. Removes the need for it being
	a global variable.

2004-09-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.c
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressdialog.c: gracefully handle progress
	calls after the widget is destroyed. Re-fixes bug #150194.

2004-09-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: always show the "Preview" check

2004-09-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-types.h (struct SFOption): changed
	"guint history" to "gint history".

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c: added callbacks for
	string entries and combo boxes and connect *all* widgets to callbacks.

	(script_fu_ok): don't touch the widgets at all but get the values
	directly now that the callbacks correctly write them to their
	structs.

	(script_fu_reset): don't copy the default values manually but
	simply set the default values on the widgets; their callbacks will
	do the rest.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_add_script):
	added some line breaks and spaces to make it more readable.

2004-09-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpui.h
	* libgimp/gimpuitypes.h

	automatically redirects any progress calls to itself while
	it exists.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-interface.c: removed all progress
	callbacks and simply use a GimpProgressBar.

2004-09-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: set a busy cursor while the
	preview is being recalculated.

	cleanups.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/pygimp-image.c
	* plug-ins/pygimp/pygimp-tile.c: Minor cleanups.

2004-08-31  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	scrollbar adjustments.

2004-09-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_preview_area_set_offsets().

2004-09-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: delay the emission of the
	"invalidated" signal using a timeout. Removed hack that used to
	invalidate the preview on button-release.

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: no need to fiddle with the slider
	update policies any longer.

2004-09-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.[ch]: added a boolean parameter to
	gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_new() to let the caller decide whether

	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* app/actions/templates-commands.c
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c
	* app/gui/gui.c
	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c: changed accordingly. Do not let
	gimp_dialog_factory_dialog_new() present the dialog if we need to

	(gimp_data_factory_view_activate_item): emit "clicked" on the
	edit_button only if it exists and is sensitive. Fixes bug #151343.

2004-08-31  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c (plug_in_open): cast plug_in_recv_message
	to GSourceFunc.

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: handle the widget size dynamically.
	Hide scrollbars when there's nothing to scroll.

	notify the "update" property on the preview, not the toggle.

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c: allow to pan the preview with all
	mouse buttons. Set a cursor to indicate that panning is possible.

2004-08-31  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.h: renamed the "updated" signal to
	"invalidated" and the confusing "update" virtual function to "draw".

	Gave the properties saner names, too.

	Removed _get_width and _get_height functions in favor of a _get_size
	one.

	Added gimp_preview_invalidate function that emits the "invalidated"
	signal if needed.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.h: modified accordingly and fixed the
	scrollbar range.

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c

	and all transform functions.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/curve_bend.c: don't use GDK_TOP_LEFT_ARROW
	to restore the default cursor, simply pass NULL to
	gdk_window_set_cursor().

2004-08-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.[ch]: added "GimpPaintInfo *paint_info"
	member and construct property. Changed gimp_paint_options_new()
	to take only a GimpPaintInfo parameter.

	* app/core/gimpitem.c (gimp_item_stroke)
	* app/core/gimppaintinfo.c (gimp_paint_info_new): changed accordingly.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c (gimp_channel_stroke)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_stroke): use
	paint_options->paint_info->paint_type directly instead of casting
	to GimpToolOptions and using
	tool_options->tool_info->paint_info->paint_type (eek). Fixes crash
	when stroking via the PDB because newly created GimpToolOptions
	instances have no "tool_info" pointer yet.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paint_tools.pdb: changed all paint PDB wrappers
	accordingly.

	* app/pdb/paint_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-08-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpconfig.c (gimp_config_iface_duplicate): set
	construct_param->foo, not construct_param*s*->foo, so we don't set
	the first construct param again and crash.

2004-08-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cubism.c: added "..." to the progress text.

2004-08-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions): added "..." to "Revert".

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpuitypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h: moved the GimpDrawablePreview
	typedef to the header file that it belongs to.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]: minor include cleanups and
	gtk-doc fixes.

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (gauss_dialog): update the preview when
	the blur radius is being changed. gimp_coordinates_new() seems to
	be broken though; there shouldn't be two signal connections needed
	here.

2004-08-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.[ch]: minor code cleanup, fixes to
	gtk-doc comments and to the handling of object properties.

2004-08-31  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreview.h: added a GimpPreview widget, abstract
	base for a GimpDrawablePreview.

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h: modified accordingly.

	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawablepreview.h: added a GimpDrawablePreview widget
	to ease	the use of previews by plug-ins.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimpui.h: Changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/common/despeckle.c
	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c
	* plug-ins/common/softglow.c
	* plug-ins/common/spread.c
	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: use a GimpDrawablePreview with these
	plug-ins.

2004-08-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.[ch]: added boolean return values
	to plug_in_progress_install(), uninstall() and cancel(). Added
	checks to make sure the installed progress_callback exists, has
	the correct signature and was installed by this plug-in.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/progress.pdb: use the return values to let the
	PDB wrappers succeed/fail.

	* app/pdb/progress_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-08-30  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added gimp_progress_install &
	gimp_progress_uninstall

2004-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpregioniterator.c: document the fact that "run_mode"
	is unused. Also did some code cleanup.

2004-08-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpregioniterator.c: always update the progress.
	Makes all "run_mode" parameters useless.

2004-08-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c: add "..." to the progress text.

2004-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpprogress.c: added some gtk-doc comments, could be
	improved further.

2004-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c
	* plug-ins/common/compose.c
	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c
	* plug-ins/common/film.c
	* plug-ins/fits/fits.c: always use the progress API, not doing it
	in non-interactive mode has always been wrong.

2004-08-30  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpprogress.[ch] (gimp_progress_uninstall): return the
	user_data pointer on uninstall. Eases language binding work.

2004-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpbrushmenu.c (gimp_brush_select_preview_draw): fixed
	drawing of brushes that extend beyond the preview.

2004-08-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.[ch] (gimp_vector_tool_status_set):
	avoid excessive use of strdup() and strcmp(). The strings are all
	constant anyway.

2004-08-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Brought the PDB progress into a working state. Fixes bug #6010,
	addresses bugs #97266 and #135185 and unfortunately reopens bug
	#150194 (will fix that later).

	* libgimpbase/gimpbaseenums.h: added enum GimpProgressCommand.

	* app/core/gimppdbprogress.c
	* libgimp/gimpprogress.c: use the enum instead of integer
	constants for the different progress commands. Cleanup.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c: switch back to real refcounting for
	plug_in->progress (reopens bug #150194) and enabled the PDB
	progress code.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: cleaned up the
	progress stuff and the script-fu interface a bit.

	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpenums.py
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.c
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: regenerated.

2004-08-29  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c (plug_in_open): set can_recurse on the
	recv_message watch, so we don't block on recursive calls to the
	handler. plug_in_recv_message needs some refcounting help now
	though.

2004-08-29  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-x86.h
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.c: Fixed a bunch of
	warnings due to bad type casting.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-x86.h
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.c:
	The last changes to fix the the clobber registers bug #147013.
	Commented out some dead code to be reviewed later.

2004-08-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Added an API to allow plug-ins to embed the progress for the
	actions they trigger into their own GUI (attention: half-done and
	broken code ahead...)

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/gimppdbprogress.[ch]: new object implementing dispatching
	progress calls to a temporary PDB procedure in a plug-in.

	* app/Makefile.am: force to link gimppdbprogress.o, bah!

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.[ch]: added API to install,
	uninstall and cancel a PDB progress for this plug-in, but disabled
	the implementation because it doesn't work yet.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/progress.pdb: added pdb wrappers for the new
	install, uninstall and cancel functions.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpprogress.[ch]: added an API around the PDB progress
	stuff.

	* app/pdb/progress_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpprogress_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c: use the new API to show
	the progress in the script-fu dialog.

2004-08-29  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added
	gimp_scale_entry_set_logarithmic

2004-08-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpconfigwriter.c: don't emit critical warnings
	about a messed up state of GimpConfigWriter if the writer is
	disabled because of a write error that occured earlier.

2004-08-29  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.h: Renamed GimpPreviewSize to GimpViewSize.

	* app/core/core-enums.c: Regenerated.

2004-08-28  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.c
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.c: More updates to accomodate
	the clobber registers. Additional progress against bug #147013.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.h: Fixed a bug where the wrong
	manifest constant definition caused sse2 instructions to never be
	compiled.

2004-08-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/vpropagate.c (run): fixed confusion about which
	mode to use when being run with last values (bug #151308).

2004-08-28  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugindetails.c: workaround to avoid a warning
	by gcc about the use of "%c" in the format string for strftime.

2004-08-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.[ch]: applied a patch from Joao
	S. O. Bueno which adds an API that allows to make the scale widget
	of a GimpScaleEntry behave logarithmic. Fixes bug #149420.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c: use the new functionality for the
	radius control.

2004-08-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-08-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-contiguous-region.c
	(find_contiguous_region_helper): applied a patch from Eric Cheung
	that changes the function to use a GQueue to implement recursion
	instead of recursive function calls. Fixes bug #151124.

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c (noisify_dialog): left-align the
	preview.

2004-08-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (toolbox_create_image_area): added a
	help-id for the image area.

2004-08-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Moved the gimp_progress_init() and gimp_progress_update() PDB
	functions to their own group because they don't belong to the
	"Plug-In" namespace and will soon get more functions.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: removed the progress stuff...

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/progress.pdb: ...and added it here.

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am
	* tools/pdbgen/groups.pl
	* app/pdb/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/Makefile.am: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/progress_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpprogress_pdb.[ch]: new generated files.

	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimp_pdb.h
	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-08-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c
	(gimp_container_editor_construct): call
	gimp_container_editor_select_item() manually at construction time
	so views show the initially selected object's state correctly
	(e.g. the brush spacing). Fixes bug #151227.

2004-08-27  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpnavigationpreview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpnavigationpreview.h: renamed these files to ...

	* app/widgets/gimpnavigationview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpnavigationview.h: to these.

	renaming process.

	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: Changed accordingly.

2004-08-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	from GimpItem::stroke().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: changed accordingly.

2004-08-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.c (gimp_item_stroke): implement the whole
	paint_options fiddling here instead of in each subclass and pass
	either GimpStrokeOptions or GimpPaintOptions (instead of
	GimpStrokeOptions or GimpPaintInfo) to GimpItem::stroke().

	Also copied code (that needs to be abstracted to a utility
	function) from the tool_manager which makes sure we really use the
	global brush, pattern etc. if these options are checked in prefs.
	Fixes bug #150716.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c (gimp_channel_stroke)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_stroke): removed the
	duplicated code mentioned above and simply use the paint_options
	passed.

2004-08-26  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderervectors.h: GimpViewRendererVector is
	really derived from GimpViewRenderer and not from
	GimpViewRendererDrawable.

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.h: modified accordingly.

2004-08-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/sanity.c (sanity_check_filename_encoding): try to convert
	the result of gimp_directory() to UTF-8 and bail out with a
	moderately helpful error message if this conversion fails. Works
	around bug #150917. Also marked these strings for translation.

2004-08-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimp-tools.c (gimp_tools_register): set the paintbrush
	as the default tool as suggested in bug #151091.

	* app/widgets/gimppreview-popup.h: renamed these files...

	* app/widgets/gimppreviewrenderer.h: renamed these files...

	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewrenderer.h: .. to these files, and changed
	GimpPreviewRenderer to GimpViewRenderer.

	This is the second step of the great Preview->View renaming process.

2004-08-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am

	* app/widgets/gimperrordialog.[ch]: added new dialog that adds a new
	GimpMessageBox for each message added. Fixes bug #92604.

	functionality.

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_abort): use a GimpMessageBox in a GimpDialog.

	when being called with a NULL domain.

2004-08-25  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.[ch]: eradicate some more previews
	in favor of views.

	* app/display/gimpnavigationview.h: renamed these files to...

	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.c
	* app/display/gimpnavigationeditor.h: ... these files, and of course
	changed GimpNavigationView to GimpNavigationEditor since it is really
	inherited from GimpEditor anyway.

	This will leave the gimp_navigation_view namespace for the renaming
	from gimp_navigation_preview.

	* app/display/Makefile.am
	* app/display/display-types.h
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: Changed accordlingly.

2004-08-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.c
	(gimp_display_shell_format_title): print bad '%' sequences
	literally instead of warning (g_warning() is for programming

	user input). Fixes bug #150676

	layouts.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpmessagebox.[ch]: added new widget GimpMessageBox.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c: use it for message dialogs.

2004-08-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_image): unset
	the filename if gtk_file_chooser_set_uri() failed.

	* app/actions/file-commands.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: trivial cleanups.

2004-08-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/Makefile.am

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: removed gimp_paint_core_constrain().

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpblendtool.[ch]: use gimp_tool_motion_constrain()
	instead of duplicating that functionality.

	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c: use gimp_tool_motion_constrain()
	instead of implementing completely different constraints.

2004-08-22  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c: Implemented the ellipse basic
	shape differently to avoid possible rounding issues with
	the _arcto () command.

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: properly close the rounded
	rectangles.

2004-08-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c (parse_svg_transform): support
	optional center coordinates for the "rotate" transformations.
	(parse_svg_transform): apply transformations in reverse order. The
	SVG spec is rather confusing here.

2004-08-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c (gimp_bezier_stroke_arcto): fixed
	a bug I introduced with my last commit.

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: added support for the basic
	SVG shape "rect". Fixed handling of SVG lengths in basic shapes.

2004-08-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_bezier_stroke_new_ellipse() that provides a simple API to
	create a bezier stroke that represents an ellipse.

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: added support for the basic
	SVG shapes "circle" and "ellipse".

2004-08-21  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: added support for the basic
	SVG shapes "polyline" and "polygon".

2004-08-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.c: added support for importing
	the basic SVG shape "line". Other shapes will follow...

2004-08-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/layers-actions.[ch]
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c: added actions to handle layer
	masks as suggested in bug #150446.

	* menus/layers-menu.xml: added menu entries for new actions,
	commented out raise/lower menu entries.

2004-08-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: declare local function as static.

2004-08-19  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c: modified the coordinate insertion
	into the file name to leave the file extension intact, changed the
	format of the coordinates. Fixes bug #101901.

2004-08-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcellrendereraccel.c
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrambox.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: Get rid of some unnecessary casts.

2004-08-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/color-notebook.c: no need to set a size_request here.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselection.c: HIG-ified spacings.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscales.c
	* modules/colorsel_cmyk.c: don't set a minimum width on the color
	scales. Improves behaviour for narrow color dockables.

2004-08-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: fixed crashes that occured with
	small sizes, some code cleanups and a simple optimization.

2004-08-18  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: define GIMP_HELP_DOCK_SEPARATOR.

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c: help-ids are never used directly,
	use the defines from app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h instead.

2004-08-17  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: Made the triangle colorselector
	resizeable. Removed minimum size request (would probably need some
	testing for *very* small sizes though).

2004-08-17  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c: add help-ids.

2004-08-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c (plug_in_progress_start): reset
	the "cancel" signal handler id when a new progress is set.

2004-08-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_cmyk.c: minor cleanups.

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: let the widget take the available
	space, don't set a minimum size.

2004-08-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c: don't keep a strong reference to the
	GimpProgress object, instead use a weak reference and deal with
	the progress being destroyed while the plug-in is running.
	Fixes bug #150194.

2004-08-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolorframe.c (gimp_color_frame_update): fixed
	labels in CMYK mode. Fixes bug #150213.

2004-08-16  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/iwarp.c: fixed a typo preventing the preview to be
	redrawn correctly in some case. Reported by AndyFitz.

2004-08-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c: minor cleanups.

	* modules/colorsel_water.c: GimpPreviewArea seems like overkill
	here, use a GtkDrawingArea instead.

2004-08-15  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* modules/colorsel_triangle.c
	* modules/colorsel_water.c: Replaced the GtkPreviews by
	GimpPreviewAreas.

2004-08-14  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimpprotocol.c (_gp_params_read): make sure array
	length values are not negative, to prevent bad calls to g_new.
	Addresses bug #150154.

2004-08-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/help/Makefile.am: no need to link gimp-help-lookup with
	any GIMP libraries.

	* plug-ins/help/domain.[ch]: allow to specify the location of the
	index files independently from the base URL.

	* plug-ins/help/help.c: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/help/gimp-help-lookup.c: added command-line options to
	specify base URI and root directory for index files.

2004-08-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/help/locales.c (locales_parse): don't mess up the order
	of languages.

	* plug-ins/help/gimp-help-lookup.c: parse command-line options,
	added --help output.

2004-08-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/help/help.[ch]: moved some defines to the header file.

	* plug-ins/help/domain.c: trivial change to remove the libgimpbase
	dependency.

	* plug-ins/help/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/help/gimp-help-lookup.c: added a very simple
	command-line tool that allows to lookup a help-id.

2004-08-13  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c: update the preview when the user choose a
	different algorithm from the combo box. This was one of the main
	reasons to have a preview here, after all.

2004-08-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c (edge_dialog): use a combo box instead of
	too many radio buttons.

2004-08-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c (gimp_menu_factory_manager_new):
	make sure that all actions, even if they have no menu proxy, can
	be invoked by their accelerators. Fixes bug #149938.

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c (gimp_image_dock_constructor):
	removed the same code here.

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.[ch] (gimp_action_view_dispose): new
	function which disconnects from "accel_changed" of the accel_group
	before upchaining (== before emitting "destroy").

	The above changes make this one redundant, but since the crash in
	bug #149938 was triggered by "accel_changed" emitted in the middle
	of g_object_unref(tree_model), it feels better to be paranoic here
	(fiddling with objects in destruction is no fun).

	(gimp_action_view_accel_edited): don't warn if assigning the same
	accel to the same action again.

	(gimp_action_view_new): don't leak all accel_closures.

2004-08-12  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/edge.c: added a preview.

2004-08-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c
	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: place the preview widget into the
	upper left corner like all other plug-ins do.

	* plug-ins/help/domain.c: added some (disabled) debug output.

2004-08-12  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sel_gauss.c: added a preview.

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: removed unused variables.

2004-08-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: changed the icons to indicate
	what part of the context is affected by the action. Looks better
	in the shortcut editor.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/cartoon.c
	* plug-ins/common/neon.c
	* plug-ins/common/photocopy.c
	* plug-ins/common/softglow.c: added four new plug-ins contributed
	by Spencer Kimball. Ported them from 1.2 to 2.1 APIs.

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: added them here.

	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl: removed tab insanity now that
	libgimpoldpreview is gone.

	* plug-ins/common/.cvsignore
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

2004-08-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	Bad DindinX! Don't break the build!

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/common/mkgen.pl
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: removed libgimpoldpreview from
	here too.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

2004-08-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	Removed the GimpOldPreview stuff. Die, crap, die!

	* plug-ins/libgimpoldpreview/*: removed.

	* plug-ins/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: changed accordingly.

	* plug-ins/common/max_rgb.c
	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c
	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c: removed last forgotten
	#include "libgimpoldpreview.h".

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainercombobox.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c: when removing the last item
	from the view, manually clear all GimpCellRendererViewables'
	"renderer" properties; otherwise we have stale GimpPreviewRenderers
	with still-refed viewables hanging around in the cells.
	Works around GTK+ bug #149906.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.c
	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c: converted tabs to spaces, cosmetic
	changes.

2004-08-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/waves.c: GimpPreviewArea-ified.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Restored sane sorting order for menus which are created
	entirely by plug-ins (like Xtns/Script-Fu/...).

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_build_path): made it
	return the built path. For each sub-menu created, add a "Menus"
	placeholder and a separator. Make sure all sub-menus end up in the
	"Menus" placeholder. More readable because we can use the path
	returned by the recursive invocation now.

	(plug_in_menus_add_proc): simplified by using the path
	plug_in_menus_build_path() returns.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpprogress.[ch]: added virtual function
	gboolean GimpProgressInterface::is_active().

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.c
	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c
	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressdialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: implement it.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.h: removed "gboolean progress_active" and
	added "gulong progress_cancel_id" instead.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c: changed accordingly. Make sure
	we correctly handle the "cancel" connections of progress instances
	passed from other plug-ins.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c (plug_in_temp_run)
	* libgimp/gimp.c (gimp_temp_proc_run): removed ENABLE_TEMP_RETURN
	#define and all code which was in #ifndef ENABLE_TEMP_RETURN.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-gui.[ch]: added "display_ID" to gimp_new_progress().

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.[ch]: reenabled showing the
	progress in a particular display.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: added a commented-out midi controller entry
	with some example mappings.

2004-08-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plasma.c: converted to GimpPreviewArea.

2004-08-11  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c: converted to GimpPreviewArea.  Also added
	scrollbars to move around.  The preview was rather useless without
	them.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c
	* app/core/gimpprogress.c: some progress cleanup.

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c (gimp_statusbar_progress_start): no
	need to warn if there is already a progress active, just silently
	return NULL as all other GimpProgressInterface implementors.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-progress.c: several progress fixes.
	It's still a mess.

	* plug-ins/common/url.c: don't show progress depending on
	run_mode. Run the actual file plug-in with the same run_mode we
	were invoked with.

2004-08-11  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressbox.c: increased horizontal size request
	to reduce resizing.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_create_thumbnails):
	fixed annoying resizing when thumbnailing exactly one image.

2004-08-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpprogressbox.[ch]: new GtkVBox subclass featuring
	a label and a progressbar. Implements GimpProgressIterface.

	* app/widgets/gimpprogressdialog.[ch]: replaced label and progress
	by a GimpProgressBox. Delegate most progress functionality to it.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: factored out utility
	function gimp_dialog_set_sensitive().

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_sensitive):
	use it.

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c (file_open_location_response):
	embed the called file procedure's progress using a GimpProgressBox.

2004-08-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]
	(gimp_file_dialog_set_sensitive): new function which works on all
	widgets in the dialog except the cancel button.

	Remember if the active progress is cancelable and added two
	booleans "busy" and "canceled". Added GtkDialog::response()
	implementation which, if the dialog is busy, cancels the active
	progress and sets the dialog's "canceled" state.

	Moved the progress bar right above the action area so it is next
	to the cancel button and in the same place for both open and save
	dialogs.

	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: use the new API to make image loading
	and saving cancelable again.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: use the same stuff to make
	thumbnailing cancelable. Increased the minimum height a bit so it
	doesn't resize when the progress bars are shown.

2004-08-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Redid the whole internal progress stuff: don't pass around
	progress_callback and progress_data; instead, provide a
	pointer to a GimpProgressInterface which can be implemented
	by a variety of backends.

	Addresses (but not yet fixes) bugs #6010, #97266 and #135185.

	* app/display/Makefile.am
	* app/display/gimpprogress.[ch]: removed the old progress hack.

	* app/core/Makefile.am

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.[ch]: added GimpProgressInterface
	implementation to these classes.

	* app/core/gimp-gui.[ch]
	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c: replaced the old progress vtable entries
	by two new to create and destroy a GimpProgressDialog in case
	no other progress is available.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.[ch]
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.[ch]
	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: pass a GimpProgress to all PDB wrappers and

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c

	of gint where appropriate.

2004-08-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c (gimp_brush_generated_load):
	plugged more file descriptor leaks.

2004-08-09  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: continuously show the (original) image
	during a scrollbar movement.  This makes it easier to navigate.

2004-08-09  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Applied (slightly modified) patch from Shlomi Fish which adds a
	progress bar to the RGB -> INDEXED conversion. Fixes bug #145274
	and shows that we really really need a GimpProgressInterface in
	the core to give progress users full access to the progress API.

	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.[ch]: added special
	GimpImageConvertProgress function typedef to cope with the
	different stages of converting.  Support passing such a callback &
	data to gimp_image_convert() and update the progress accordingly.

	* app/gui/convert-dialog.[ch]: added a convert progress callback
	and pass it to gimp_image_convert().

	* app/actions/image-commands.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/convert.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/convert_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-08-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Fixes bug #149678.

	(plug_ins_file_register_mime): moved returning the proc_def inside
	the right if() statement.

2004-08-09  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* app/core/gimp-edit.c (gimp_edit_paste_as_new):
	gimp_create_display() with the right parameters order

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_message_box_set_icons)
	handle gtk_style_lookup_icon_set() returnig NULL

	* app/gimpcore.def app/widgets/makefile.msc
	  themes/default/images/makefile.msc : updated

2004-08-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/postscript.c (save_ps_header): use the basename
	as Title, not the full filename. Fixes bug #149669.

2004-08-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod/sliba.c (array_prin1): when printing a
	character array, don't flush the buffer for each byte but wait
	until it is filled.

2004-08-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.[ch] (siod_output_string): use
	g_strdup_vprintf() instead of guessing the string length. Also
	declare the function using G_GNUC_PRINTF().

2004-08-08  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/README.ifscompose: fix out of date info,
	pointed out by the author.

2004-08-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am: do not build test-preview-area by
	default, put it into EXTRA_PROGRAMS. Fixes parallel builds.

2004-08-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch] (plug_in_proc_def_get_sensitive):
	new function which checks a GimpImageType against the
	proc_def->image_types_val mask.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use the new function here. Also
	separated setting the "Repeat last" and "Reshow last" actions'
	labels from setting their sensitivity and made them use the same
	sensitivity logic as all other plug-in actions. Fixes bug #149567.

2004-08-07  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscales.c: emit the COLOR_CHANGED signal
	when the hex entry is changed.

2004-08-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-08-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpgradientmenu.c (gimp_gradient_select_preview_expose):
	corrected dither offset.

2004-08-07  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	cleanup and removed tabs.

2004-08-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	"gdouble aspect_ratio"...

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.[ch]: ...and added it where it belongs.

2004-08-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Transform tool cleanup:

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: added new virtual function
	GimpTransformTool::dialog_update().
	Made wrapper for ::recalc() public and function
	transform_bounding_box() private.
	Call ::dialog_update() and transform_bounding_box() from the
	::recalc() wrapper.

	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.[ch]: turned all info_dialog update
	functions into GimpTransformTool::dialog_update() implementations
	and don't call them from ::recalc(), also removed calls to
	transform_bounding_box(); both functions are called by the parent
	class now. Call gimp_transform_tool_recalc() when dialog values
	were changed, not the tool's internal function.
	Moved all static variables to the instance structs.

2004-08-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.[ch]: applied (modified) patch from Ari
	Pollak which enables controlling the shear direction from the
	dialog and changing the shear direction without hitting "Reset".
	Fixes bug #149467.

	Also moved all static variables to the GimpShearTool struct and
	converted tabs to spaces.

2004-08-06  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/nova.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea.

2004-08-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/test-color-parser.c: include <glib-object.h>.

2004-08-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/depthmerge.c:

	tw_sess.c here.

2004-08-05  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/wind.c: ported to GimpPreviewArea (from
	GimpOldPreview)

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	to 9 pixels (which is the same as in the path tool) as suggested
	in bug #134250.

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.c: make the cursor coordinates label
	insensitive when displaying out-of-image coordinates.

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h (INSTALL_COLORMAP_BLURB):
	s/pseudocolor visuals/8-bit (256 colors) displays/.
	Fixes bug #137078.

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Enabled previewing items without selecting them in all list and
	grid views using mouse button 2. Implicitly enables previewing of
	items in container popups and thus fixes bug #121011:

	* app/widgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_button_press_event)
	* app/widgets/gimpcellrendererviewable.c
	(gimp_cell_renderer_viewable_clicked): show the preview also on
	mouse button 2 click.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c
	(gimp_container_tree_view_button_press): dispatch mouse button 2
	clicks to GimpCellRendererViewable, but don't select or change
	anything in the tree_view.

	Unrelated cleanup:

	* app/widgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_button_press_event):
	don't offset bevent->x,y by widget->allocation.x,y before calling
	gimp_preview_popup_show() ...

	* app/widgets/gimppreview-popup.c (gimp_preview_popup_show):
	... instead, do it here generically (check if the parent widget is
	GTK_WIDGET_NO_WINDOW()).

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintstore.c (gimp_int_store_add_empty):
	allocate the empty_iter using g_new0(). Fixes valgrind warnings
	about reads from uninitialized memory.

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: use GTK_STOCK_JUMP_TO for
	all "Set" actions (like context-foreground-red-set).

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.h: applied patch from Jordi Gay
	(attached to bug #131111) which adds an aspect ratio spinbutton to
	the scale dialog and keeps the aspect ratio intact when width or
	height are changed using the dialog. Fixes bug #132274.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c: don't set the aspect spinbuttons to
	"wrap" and decrease their climb_rate.

2004-08-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added actions, callbacks and menu items
	for the brush shape and spikes.

2004-08-04  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/grid.c: changed the default colors for the
	first invocation to the current foregroud color which is more
	likely to be useful than the blue shades.

2004-08-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* themes/Default/images/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/stock-brush-generated-*-16.png: removed ...

	* themes/Default/images/stock-shape-*-16.png: ... and added back
	with more generic names.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpinkoptions-gui.c: use the new stock icons here as
	well.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpblobeditor.[ch]: added a simple blob shape
	editor widget factored out of app/tools/gimpinkoptions-gui.c.

2004-08-04  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c: Enhanced the range of the hardness
	parameter to make more soft brushes possible. Please note that this
	makes existing generated brushes look more soft. But since people
	apparently rarely use more than one or two generated brushes and
	these get changed frequently I guess it should be OK.

2004-08-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Allow URI drops from apps linked against GLib < 2.4.4 to GIMP
	linked against GLib >= 2.4.5. Fixes bug #148140.

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch]: added gimp_check_glib_version().

	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.c: added runtime check for GLib
	versions that encode file:// URIs correctly (>= 2.4.5). For older
	(broken) GLibs, leave the code path as is, for newer (fixed) ones,
	perform an additional check if the dropped URI is in the (broken)
	escaped-UTF-8 format and convert it to local filename encoding.

	* app/gui/gui.c: warn the user that non-ASCII filenames can't
	be used when linked against GLib 2.4.4.

2004-08-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: changed member "ProcRecord *last_plug_in"
	to "PlugInProcDef *last_plug_in". Added function
	gimp_set_last_plug_in() and signal Gimp::last-plug-in-changed.

	* app/actions/plug-in-commands.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: factored out updating of the
	"Reshow Last" and "Rerun Last" actions to a private function.
	Connect each "plug-in" action group to Gimp::last-plug-in-changed
	and update the actions' label and sensitivity in the
	callback. Fixes bug #149139.

2004-08-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c: #include "core/gimpimage-undo.h"

	work.

2004-08-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c
	(gimp_container_grid_view_item_context): ref/unref the view around
	the calls to gimp_container_view_item_selected() and _item_context()
	because the former may destroy the view which leads to a crash
	when trying the latter. Fixes bug #148955.

2004-08-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo.[ch] (gimp_image_undo_can_compress):
	new function which checks if undo compression is possible:

	(1) is the image dirty? Fixes bug #148853.
	(2) is redo stack empty?
	(3) do both the passed undo object_type and undo_type
	    match the top undo item?

	Consistently name the GType and GimpUndoType passed to undo
	functions "object_type" and "undo_type" to avoid confusion.

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c: use the new utility function
	instead of checking the above conditions manually.

2004-08-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c (gimp_brush_generated_load): don't
	leak the brush's name if parsing the shape fails.

	(gimp_brush_generated_dirty): shut up bogus compiler warnings
	about uninitialized variables.

	Applied a bunch of small changes contributed by Tim Mooney to fix
	stack corruption on Tru64 and Aix (bug #129867).

	* app/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/script-fu/Makefile.am: changed the dependency order so
	that $(REGEXREPL) is linked earlier.

	* regexrepl/regex.[ch]: fixed check for __STDC__, merged upstream
	fix for re_max_failures value.

2004-07-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: always do the check for perl and use the
	substituted perl executable name in the call for gimp-mkenums.
	Fixes the build on platforms where perl is not available as
	/usr/bin/perl. Closes bug #148813.

	* app/widgets/gimpenumstore.c: added missing include.

2004-07-30  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c: GtkPreview->GtkDrawingArea, plus
	some minor code cleanups.

2004-07-30  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/CML_explorer.c: Transformed one GtkPreview to a

	makes the code simpler.

2004-07-30  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c (gimp_preview_area_draw):
	corrected a typo causing mayhem in previews of non-alpha grayscale

2004-07-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c (gimp_preview_area_draw):

	* app/gui/tips-parser.c
	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.c
	* app/tools/tools-enums.h
	* app/widgets/gimpdasheditor.c

2004-07-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: removed preview code that isn't used
	any longer.

2004-07-30  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bumpmap.c: use GimpPreviewArea instead of
	GtkPreview (which leads to much simpler code)

2004-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.c: only invalidate the buffer
	on size_allocate; allocate a new one on the next call to
	gimp_preview_area_draw(). Fixed buffer offset in expose method.

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/test-preview-area.c: more a benchmark than a
	test; quite similar to testrgb from the GTK+ source tree.

2004-07-29  DindinX  <david@dindinx.org>

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.c: converted all GtkPreview
	widgets to GimpPreviewArea.

2004-07-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpmodule/gimpmoduledb.c: converted tabs to spaces, removed

	of gimpressionist_vals_t.

2004-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppreviewarea.[ch]: added GimpPreviewArea, a
	replacement for GtkPreview, loosely based on patches from Geert
	Jordaens and David Odin. Fixes bug #144759.

	* plug-ins/common/sharpen.c: use the new widget instead of a
	GtkPreview; saves about 100 lines of rather complex code :)

2004-07-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: changed default configuration of the keyboard
	controller: scroll the display one step on cursor_key, scroll by
	one page on <shift>+cursor_key and scroll to top/bottom/left/right
	on <control>+cursor_key. Fixes bug #53988.

	Moved the old opacity-modifying actions to <alt>+cursor_key.

2004-07-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Replaced the concept of having a boolean indicating if an undo
	step dirties the image by a bitfield indicating which parts
	of the image are dirtied:

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: reordered two values in enum
	GimpUndoType, added GIMP_DIRTY_IMAGE_SIZE to enum GimpDirtyMask.

	The values of GimpDirtyMask are still questionable and will
	probably change...

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: removed signal "undo_start" and added
	a GimpDirtyMask parameter to the "dirty" and "clean" signals.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo.[ch] (gimp_image_undo_push): replaced
	"gboolean dirties_image" by "GimpDirtyMask dirty_mask" and pass
	it to gimp_image_dirty().

	(gimp_image_undo_group_start): added *ugly* code which tries to
	figure GimpDirtyMask from the group's GimpUndoType and store it in
	the GimpUndoGroup. Call gimp_image_dirty() instead of the removed
	gimp_image_undo_start(). This means the undo group now dirties the
	image just like one of its undo steps, but that's no problem since
	undoing cleans it in the same way.

	* app/core/gimpundo.[ch]: s/dirties_image/dirty_mask/g

	(gimp_undo_pop): emit clean/dirty signals *before* performing the
	actual undo step so listeners can detach from the image before it
	is changed by undo.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (gimp_image_undo_push_*): pass a
	GimpDirtyMask instead of TRUE/FALSE to gimp_image_undo_push().

	* app/core/gimpimagemap.[ch]: removed "gboolean interactive"
	because it makes no sense to use GimpImageMap noninteractively.
	Don't freeze()/thaw() undo while the image_map is active which
	fixes many ways of trashing the image's undo state but probably
	introduces new ways of doing evil things.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-foreach.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c: changed according
	to the GimpImage::clean()/dirty() signal changes. Small fixes
	in the quit dialog's dirty image container.

	* app/tools/gimptoolcontrol.[ch]: added member and API to
	set/get the dirty_mask.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: whenever setting "preserve" to
	FALSE, also set a "dirty_mask" which specifies on which image
	changes the tool wants to be canceled.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: removed "undo_start" connection and
	connect to both "dirty" *and* "clean" to check if the active_tool
	needs to be canceled. Cancel the tool only if the dirty_mask
	passed in the signal has common bits with the tool's dirty_mask.

	Fixes bug #109561 and probably opens some new ones...

2004-07-29  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def
	* libgimp/gimpui.def: added some missing symbols

2004-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimpbase.def: added new symbols.

2004-07-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Added support for motion event history as provided by some input
	device drivers. If you have a tablet driver supporting this,
	please try and report back.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.h (struct GimpDisplayShell): added
	member "guint32 last_motion_time".

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_tool_events): remember the last_motion_time on
	button_press() and after motion() and ask the current device for
	its motion history; in motion(), if the active_tool asks for exact
	motions, check if the input device recorded a motion history and
	process the history instead of the motion event.

	(gimp_display_shell_get_time_coords): new utility function which
	gets GimpCoords from a GdkTimeCoord struct as used by the motion
	history.

2004-07-29  Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/repaint.c: converted a multiple if into
	a nested one.

	* app/core/core-enums.h: removed enums GimpImageType and
	GimpImageBaseType ...

	* libgimp/gimp.c: include <glib-object.h>

	* libgimpbase/gimpbasetypes.[ch]: added API to set and get a
	translation domain on a GType. This is used for translatable enum
	values.

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.[ch]: added API to retrieve the translated
	name for an enum value.

	* app/widgets/gimpenumstore.c
	* app/widgets/gimpenumwidgets.c: use the new API in libgimpbase.

2004-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c: fixed gtk-doc comments.

2004-07-29  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c: Stop signed ints overflowing
	while getting the mean by replacing (a + b) / 2 with a / 2 + b / 2.
	Fixes bug #128594 for drawables less than 32K wide.

2004-07-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: renamed "Cleared saved foobar now"
	buttons to "Reset saves foobar to default values". Fixes bug #5673.
	Added mnemonics for all the configure/save/reset buttons.

2004-07-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_free_script):
	applied patch by Kevin Cozens that moves a g_free() to the right
	place (bug #148729).

2004-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_groups): register the
	GIMP_STOCK_VISIBLE icon with the "view" action group.

2004-07-28  Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/brush.c: removed a redundant parameter
	from one of the internal functions.
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/utils.c: Made sure that resources that
	are selected by the presets will position their list views
	accordingly.

2004-07-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: if the check for libtoolize fails, try glibtoolize.

2004-07-28  Shlomi Fish <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/presets.c: created a base function for
	two functions with duplicate code.

2004-07-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_default_dialog.c: no need to include
	"libgimp/stdplugins-intl.h" here.

2004-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): reordered
	buttons in the Interface -> Keyboard Shortcuts section to be
	consistent with other sections which provide configure/save/clear
	buttons.

2004-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpbycolorselecttool.c (gimp_by_color_select_tool_init)
	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c (gimp_color_picker_tool_init):
	don't call gimp_tool_control_set_preserve (tool->control, FALSE)
	because these tools don't cache any image state and don't care
	about the image changing under their feet.

2004-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_reconnect):
	emit "reconnect" *before* emitting scale and scroll events so
	listeners (the navigation view) can switch to the new image at the
	right time.

2004-07-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-07-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c
	(gimp_action_group_set_action_label): forgot to strip mnemonics
	here.

	not an individual header out of libgimpbase.

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/Makefile.am
	* libgimpbase/gimpbase.h
	* libgimpbase/gimpbase.def
	* libgimpbase/gimpmemsize.[ch]: added new files with memsize
	related functions (moved here from gimputil.c) and

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.[ch]: removed gimp_memsize_to_string() here.

	* libgimpbase/gimpunit.[ch]: added GIMP_TYPE_UNIT (moved here from

004-07-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/Makefile.am
	* libgimp/gimp.h
	* libgimp/gimpui.h
	* libgimp/gimppalettemenu.[ch]
	* libgimp/gimppaletteselect.[ch]: added palette select wrapper and

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: added SF_PALETTE so it can

	parameter to the test script.

2004-07-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_finalize): remove the image
	from the image hash table and set its "gimp" pointer to NULL
	*after* all layers, channels, vectors and the selection are
	finalized; otherwise these items have no chance of removing
	themselves from the item hash table (because image->gimp is
	already NULL). Spotted by pgimeno and nomis.
	(should be backported after it got some testing)

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h removed unused help IDs
	GIMP_HELP_FILE_OPEN_XCF and GIMP_HELP_FILE_SAVE_XCF. The help IDs
	for these entries are generated from the procedure names.

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help): print the help-id and
	help-domain to stdout if gimp was started with the --verbose
	command-line option.

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_add_filters):
	show extensions in the filters menu. Is this a good idea at all?

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpbrushmenu.c
	* libgimp/gimppatternmenu.c: attempt to make the brush and pattern
	selectors look less like buttons (supposed to fix bug #147777).

2004-07-27  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorhexentry.c (gimp_color_hex_entry_events):
	also accept the short hexadecimal notation (3 hex digits).

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am (libgimpwidgetsinclude_HEADERS):

	new toggle cell renderer.

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.[ch] (procedural_db_free_data): new
	function which clears the whole list of data set by plug-ins.

	(procedural_db_free): use it.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-commands.[ch]: added action, callback and
	confirmation dialog for "Reset all filters to default values".
	Somehow addresses bug #81015.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added a help ID for the new action.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added it to the "Filters" submenu.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcellrenderercolor.c

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: added a de-allocation to the PPM's
	allocated by the size map dialog.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.c: load all linear gradients from an
	SVG file, not only the first one.

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.h: added "gboolean writable" to the
	GimpDataFactoryLoaderEntry struct. Return a GList* instead of
	GimpData* from GimpDataLoadFunc so it's possible to load more than
	one data object from one file.

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c (gimp_data_factory_load_data):
	changed accordingly: add all items of the returned lists to the
	data factory. Make the data object writable only if it's in the

	*and* the returned list contains exactly one element.

	* app/core/gimp.c (gimp_real_initialize): declare all loader

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcellrenderercolor.[ch]: added a GimpRGB cell
	renderer.

	renders the color to a buffer for internal use in libgimpwidgets.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorhexentry.c: use the new cell renderer
	for the completion popup.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolor.def
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added new symbols.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-07-26  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: placed all the orientation map-related
	public functions in orientmap.h. Now we're freeing the PPM's that it
	is allocating by a call to orientation_map_free_resources().

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-types.h: removed unused typedef
	GimpDataObjectLoaderFunc.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c
	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb.h: added new function gimp_rgb_list_names()
	that gives access to the list of SVG color keywords.

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorhexentry.[ch]: added new widget that
	allows to enter colors in hex notation or by using color names.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscales.c: use a GimpColorHexEntry.

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.[ch]: renamed init_edit_selection()
	to gimp_edit_selection_tool_start(). Removed enum EditType.

	duplicating the same code three times, don't include
	"gimpeditselectiontool.h".

	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c: don't include
	"gimpeditselectiontool.h".

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c: don't freeze()/thaw() the
	image's undo to prevent live-movement from ending up on the undo
	stack. Instead, just stop pushing undo steps after the initial
	movement. Simplifies edit_select's undo code quite a bit and fixes
	bug #148458.

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscales.c (gimp_color_scales_hex_events):
	accept SVG color names in the hex entry. Not very intuitive but
	probably a nice experts feature and it can be improved later.

2004-07-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c (main): use #ifdef GIMP_UNSTABLE instead of looking
	at GIMP_MINOR_VERSION.

	* app/app_procs.c: don't #include "tools/gimp-tools.h".

2004-07-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/bmp/bmp.h
	* plug-ins/bmp/bmpread.c: applied a patch by Brion Vibber that
	fixes extra data overflow, nonstandard 16bpp field arrangement
	and unrecognized compression (bug #143682).

2004-07-25  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/decompose.c: clamp results of LAB decomposition
	so that out-of-gamut conversions do not overflow and get badly
	distorted.  Fixes bug #147603.  Note that it would probably be a
	good idea to do similar things for other conversion types.

2004-07-25  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: converted checks for initialization of
	ppm's done by checking the "col" buffer, to macro calls.

2004-07-25  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: fixed bug #148088: ("Gimpressioinst
	crashes if given malicious presets with out of range values, in
	the radio buttons group numeric values: "placetype", "orienttype",
	etc. ").

	This was done by adding clamps to the relevant values in the preset.

2004-07-25  Raphaël Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* INSTALL: Minor fixes and improvements.  Suggest using a
	different prefix and setting PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR if old versions of
	GTK+ libs are found and cannot be removed without breaking other
	packages.

2004-07-23  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: created a header "orientation.h"
	for the Orientation tab specific declarations.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimppixbuf.c (gimp_pixbuf_from_data): added missing code
	for grayscale previews.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.c (svg_parser_end_element): fixed
	handling of the last gradient segment and did some code cleanup.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.c (gimp_gradient_load_svg): improved
	error message.
	(svg_parser_end_element): don't crash on empty gradient definitions.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/test-color-parser.c: added more test samples.

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c: fixed a bug that I found with the
	new tests.

	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.c: changed SVG parser to handle
	gradients that are defined more deeply in the SVG hierarchy. Added
	a simplistic CSS style parser to deal with gradient definitions
	that use CSS to define the gradient stop properties (closes bug
	#148127).

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c: some newlines to improve error
	messages.

	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.c (gimp_gradient_load_svg): fixed
	error handling.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/Makefile.am
	* libgimpcolor/test-color-parser.c: added a simple unit test
	framework for the color parser.

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c: fixed parsing of rgba() values.

	* libgimpmath/test-md5.c: minor cleanup.

2004-07-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c (gimp_rgba_parse_css): added support
	for the "transparent" color name.

2004-07-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c
	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb.h: improved the CSS color parser code,
	added new function gimp_rgba_parse_css(), added support for HSL
	color values.

2004-07-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb-parse.c
	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb.h: use a signed integer to pass the string
	length to the new parser functions. The API explicitely asks for
	-1 to be passed...

	* app/core/gimp.c
	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpgradient.h: added preliminary support for loading
	simple SVG gradients (see bug #148127).  Be careful with this new
	feature; editing the loaded gradient will cause the SVG file to be
	overwritten! Work in progress...

2004-07-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/gimpgradient-load.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpgradient-save.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpgradient.[ch]: moved gradient file handling out of
	gimpgradient.c to new files.

	* app/actions/gradients-commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolor.def: added gimp_rgb_parse_name.

2004-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* data/misc/gimp.desktop.in.in (MimeType): image/g -> image/g3fax.

2004-07-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c: rephrased the text for the dialog
	that appears if a new shortcut collides with an existing one.

	* libgimpcolor/gimprgb.[ch]: added new function gimp_rgb_parse_name()
	which accepts RGB colors in hexadecimal notation or as SVG color
	keywords.

2004-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_resume):
	s/pause/resume/ in the API docs.

2004-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c (main): correctly convert relative paths to
	URIs. Append the resulting URI only if it's not NULL.

2004-07-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (toolbox_create_tools): connect to
	"accel-changed" of the accel_group using connect_object(), not
	just connect() so we don't crash when it's emitted after the
	toolbox is destroyed.

2004-07-21  Ray Strode  <rstrode@redhat.com>

	* gimp/data/misc/gimp.desktop.in.in: Add MimeType line to desktop
	file for new MIME system.

2004-07-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gif.c: declared global const variable as static.
	Fixes compiler warnings seen with gcc 3.4.1 (don't ask me why).

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c
	* plug-ins/common/gif.c
	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: set GTK_SHADOW_IN on scrolled windows of
	text views. Fixes bug #148025.

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Enabled the various "Clear saved foobar now" buttons in prefs:

	* app/gui/session.[ch]
	* app/menus/menus.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdevices.[ch]: implemented the _clear()
	functions: unlink() the rc file and set an internal flag that it
	has been deleted. Added "gboolean always_save" parameter to the
	_save() functions and don't save anything if it is FALSE and the
	internal deletion flag has been set.

	* app/gui/gui.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdevicestatus.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added callbacks for all "Save now"
	and "Clear now" buttons and show error messages if clearing fails.
	Inform the user that she has to restart GIMP to see the effect of
	the clearing.

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list
	* app/widgets/gimpcellrendereraccel.[ch]: added "gboolean delete"
	parameter to the GimpCellRendererAccel::accel_edited() signal.

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c: distinguish between deletion of an
	accelerator and the user entering an invalid accelerator.

2004-07-21  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: normalized the identifiers in
	placement.c.

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: changed names of actions which
	select brushes, patterns etc. from e.g. "context-brush-first" to
	"context-brush-select-first".

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: changed accordingly.

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: remember the keyboard shortcut
	dialog and show it only once.

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcellrendereraccel.c: minor cleanups.

	Seems to work pretty well now and thus fixes bug #142922.

2004-07-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list
	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcellrendereraccel.[ch]: new cell renderer
	which displays an accelerator and allows to edit it (ripped
	out of libegg and modified).

	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.c: use the new renderer and connect
	to its "accel-edited" signal (its callback is one huge mess that
	needs to be cleaned up). Added ugly hack to work around GTK+ API
	limitation that seems to prevent implementing a shortcut editor in
	a sane way.

	* app/actions/file-actions.c
	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: added ugly hacks here, too.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: relaced Cancel/Ok in the shortcut
	editor by Close.

2004-07-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added back "pa" for Punjabi now that
	the missing po files have been added (tips/pa.po is still missing
	though).

2004-07-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactionfactory.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added "label" and "stock-id"
	properties to GtkActionGroup and allow to register them in the
	GimpActionFactory.

	* app/actions/actions.c: register user visible labels and icons
	with all action groups.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpactionview.[ch]: new widget which shows a
	treeview of action groups and their actions & shortcuts.

	* app/widgets/gimpaction.[ch]: added gimp_action_name_compare()
	utility function.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: added
	gimp_get_accel_string() utility function.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: added
	gimp_controllers_get_ui_manager() which will be used for setting
	up the controller mapping dialog.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added a "Configure Keyboard
	Shortcuts" button which pops up a GimpActionView. Work in
	progress...

2004-07-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-actions.c: make sure that the "image-new" and
	"image-new-from-image" actions always have the same shortcut.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_preview.h
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_shade.c
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c: completely reworked UI for
	lighting page.  Now supports up to 6 lights (more is trivial).
	Added ability to temporarily isolate selected light.  Added
	light intensity controls.  Can interactively position each light
	(does not quite work yet for directional lights).

2004-07-20  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: added an icon to the
	"tools-visibility" action.

2004-07-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite.c (gimp_composite_init): now that
	the output depends on --verbose, enable it for stable releases also.

2004-07-20  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/presets.c: fixed the incorrect strings
	for input and output of the preset's fields. (a relic of an
	irresponsible search-and-replace script).

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/: normalized the identifiers of
	orientmap.c.

2004-07-20  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/Makefile.am (regenerate): Updated make-installer.py
	command line to take advantage of the new compile time method of
	determining which instruction set to compile.

	* app/composite/gimp-composite.c (gimp_composite_init): Print the
	list of active instruction sets if the --verbose command line
	switch is ON (via be_verbose)

	and sse implementations.

	* app/composite/make-installer.py: Raised the number of test
	iterations from 1 to 10.

2004-07-16  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-mmx.[ch]
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse.[ch]
	* app/composite/gimp-composite-sse2.[ch]:

	We've had trouble compiling with the Intel compiler which
	identifies itself as GCC, but doesn't support the same extended
	assembly features/misfeatures as GCC.  With the help of the Intel
	compiler group, we've determined that the Intel compiler can be
	identified at compile time by the definition of the preprocessor
	variable __INTEL_COMPILER.

	These changes make all of the assembly code currently written to
	simply avoid the Intel compiler.

	This is an interim solution to get a build working despite the
	Intel compiler.  A more correct solution has been identified, see
	the discussion of bug #147013 for more information.

2004-07-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/bz2.c
	* plug-ins/common/gz.c: don't register "xcf.gz" and "xcf.bz2"
	extension. It's redundant and breaks the code that sets the
	extension from the selected file-type.

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: massively changed: removed
	message_ids, the message mem chunk and all signals. Added new
	function gimp_statusbar_replace() which updates a message without
	moving it to the top of the stack. Fixes bug #120175.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.[ch]: renamed
	gimp_display_shell_update_title() to

	freeze/thaw property notifications around undoing/redoing so they
	are not emitted in the middle of the undo operation.

2004-07-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/core-types.h

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpimagemap.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpprojection.[ch]: implement GimpPickableInterface
	and removed public get_colot_at() functions.

	* app/core/gimpimage-pick-color.[ch]: removed typedef
	GimpImagePickColorFunc and gimp_image_pick_color_by_func(). Use

	* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c
	* app/gui/info-window.c

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.c: use GimpPickable functions
	instead of the various get_color_at() functions. Simplifies code
	which has a "sample_merged" boolean. Various cleanups.

2004-07-13  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/presets.c: Added underscores between
	words in function names according to the GIMP's (and common
	sense) convention.

2004-07-13  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

2004-07-13  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.[ch}
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.h: Made Cancel work properly.  Moved "show grid",
	"snap to grid", and "show image" checkbuttons back onto main
	interface.  Eliminated GtkPreview and removed undef of
	GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED from gfig-preview.c.  Removed some
	unused code.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c (preview_handle_idle): use
	gtk_widget_queue_draw_area() instead of the deprecated
	gtk_widget_draw() routine.

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/orientmap.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/paper.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/sizemap.c: use gtk_widget_queue_draw()

2004-07-13  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/preview.c
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/sizemap.c:
	eliminated two compile-time warnings.

2004-07-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Added a GimpProjection object which maintains the idle projection
	logic that was in GimpDisplay and takes care of constructing the
	projection even without any display open. Makes color picking and
	other reads from the projection work without display and fixes the
	major bug that we were constructing the projection n times (!)
	for n displays.

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/gimpimage-projection.[ch]: removed.

	* app/core/core-types.h
	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list

	the pieces of gimpdisplay.c and gimpimage-projection.c.

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: create a GimpProjection.
	Removed explicit projection realloc calls because the projection
	connects to the relevant GimpImage signals now.
	Added gimp_image_coords_in_active_drawable().

	* app/display/Makefile.am
	* app/display/gimpdisplay-area.[ch]: removed.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.[ch]: stripped away the idle render stuff
	and just keep a list of update_areas which is painted on flush().
	Removed gimp_display_coords_in_active_drawable().

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-foreach.[ch]: removed
	gimp_display_finish_draw().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppixmap.[ch]: declared GimpPixmap as deprecated.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.[ch]: ditto for gimp_pixmap_button_new().

	* plug-ins/Lighting/ChangeLog: removed outdated and unused ChangeLog.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/Lighting/*.xpm: removed XPM files...

	* configure.in
	* plug-ins/Lighting/images: ... and added them as PNG images here.
	These should be redone with antialiased edges.

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_stock.[ch]
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c: register stock icons and use
	those instead of GimpPixmaps.

	* plug-ins/MapObject/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/MapObject/*.xpm: removed duplicated XPM files.

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_stock.[ch]: register stock icons
	reusing the generated header from the Lighting plug-in.

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c: use them.

	* plug-ins/pagecurl/pagecurl.c: undef GIMP_DISABLE_DEPRECATED until
	GimpPixmap has been replaced here as well.

2004-07-13  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/presets.c: fixed bug #147483 (gimpressionist
	will delete global presets if the user running GIMP has priviliges to
	do so). This was done by creating a function to check if a preset is
	global, and by making sure the delete button is in-sensitive when
	this is the case.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorbutton.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolornotebook.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscale.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorscales.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselect.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorselection.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c
	* libgimpwidgets/gimppickbutton.c

2004-07-13  Shlomi Fish  <shlomif@iglu.org.il>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/*.[ch]: normalized some of brush.c's
	identifiers (= variable names and function name)

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.c (gimp_g_value_get_memsize): handle NULL
	string values.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: override the output_message error
	handler in order to propagate warnings to the user interface
	(related to bug #145212).

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_g_value_get_memsize() that attempts to calculate the memory
	requirements for a GValue.

	* app/text/gimptextundo.c (gimp_text_undo_get_memsize): use the
	new function to obtain a better estimate for the size of the text
	undo.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_create_layer): plugged
	a tiny memory leak.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo.c: resurrected some bit-rotting debug
	code. Might become useful one day.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: when automake 1.8 is being used, require at least
	version 1.8.3. Earlier versions of the automake-1.8 series don't
	handle gimp-console correctly.

2004-07-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpconfig-dump.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.c
	(gimp_display_shell_format_title): applied patch from Dave Neary
	which adds %B which expands to (modified) if the image is
	dirty. Also added %A which expands to (clean) because we also have
	a short indicator for the clean image. Fixes bug #130943.

2004-07-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: removed hack for gimp-console compilation.
	automake seems to handle it correctly all by itself.

2004-07-12  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/app_procs.c: added
	#ifdef G_OS_WIN32
	#include <windows.h>

	buffer.

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am: make sure that gimp-console is enabled for
	'make dist'. Use it to dump the system gimprc and gimprc man-page.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimptextundo.[ch]: removed member "guint time"...

	* app/core/gimpundo.[ch]: ...and added it here.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_apply): changed
	accordingly. Reordered undo compression code to look like other
	pieces of code which do undo compression.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpundo.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpitemundo.[ch]
	* app/text/gimptextundo.[ch]: removed all _new() functions and
	added properties and GObject::constructor() implementations
	instead.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo.[ch] (gimp_image_undo_push): added
	"GType undo_gtype" parameter and allow to pass name-value pairs as
	"...". Use the new GParameter utility functions to construct the
	appropriate undo step with g_object_newv().

	(gimp_image_undo_push_item): removed.

	(gimp_image_undo_push_undo): removed. Merged its code back into
	gimp_image_undo_push(), where it originally came from.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c
	* app/core/gimpundostack.c
	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-undo.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool-undo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: some include cleanups. Use
	libgimpbase/gimpwin32-io.h instead of defining W_OK explicitely.
	Don't undef GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED except for gfig-preview.c.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/round-corners.scm: applied patch from
	Dave Neary that changes the behavior from undo disable/enable to
	using an undo group if the script doesn't work on a copy of the
	image. Fixes bug #146344.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: applied patch from Brion Vibber
	which adds <Toolbox>/Acquire/Paste as new. Fixes bug #147358.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-modules.c: don't do anything if gimp->no_interface
	is TRUE.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made the gimp-console binary compile.
	Finishes core/GUI separation and fixes bug #71514:

	* configure.in: removed the crazy-hacker warning for
	--enable-gimp-console.

	* app/Makefile.am: for gimp-console, copy app_procs.c to
	app_procs_console.c and compile it instead of app_procs.c with
	-DGIMP_CONSOLE_COMPILATION

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: added some #ifndef GIMP_CONSOLE_COMPILATION
	to skip GUI stuff for the gimp-console case.
	Renamed app_gui_libs_init() to app_libs_init(), renamed
	app_gui_abort() to app_abort() and added app_exit() so everything
	that needs #ifdefs lives here now.

	* app/main.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_abort): really abort (call exit()).

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: made the suggestion to use binary packages more
	prominent, mention --enable-gimp-console.

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c: ... and do it here from gui_libs_init().

	* app/main.c: changed accordingly.

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/app_procs.s: don't use gtk_main() / gtk_main_quit() but run
	our own main-loop like we already used to do when being run
	non-interactively.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c
	(gimp_dialog_factories_set_busy_foreach)
	(gimp_dialog_factories_unset_busy_foreach): set/unset the busy
	cursor on all windows which have widget->window, not only for
	those which are GTK_WIDGET_VISIBLE. Fixes stale busy cursors when
	dialogs are hidden while the busy cursor is active and later shown
	again.

2004-07-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.c: added an "id" CONSTRUCT_ONLY
	property. Some minor cleanup.

	container when they become clean. Should move to the Gimp object.

	* app/gui/quit-dialog.c: some cosmetic changes.

2004-07-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c: applied a patch from Brion Vibber that
	sets the 'Save color values from transparent pixels' insensitive
	when there's no alpha channel.

	  app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c : bumped compiler version check,
	msvc6 still can't cast from unsigned __int64 to double

	* app/actions/debug-actions.c : only use debug_*_callback
	and thus debug_action if ENABLE_DEBUG_MENU

	* app/core/gimpalette-import.c : added gimpwin32-io.h

	* plug-ins/common/convmatrix.c : s/snprintf/g_snprintf/

	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c : make it compile with msvc,

2004-07-11  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdevices.c (gimp_devices_check_change): Applied a
	patch from Robert Ögren, moved here from toolbox_check_device().
	Only change devices if the event came from a widget that accepts
	extension events. Fixes bug #115774.

2004-07-11  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch] (gimp_parameters_append)
	(gimp_parameters_append_valist)

	* app/pdb/display_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/help_cmds.c: regenerated.

	that manipulate them. Created new headers. Renamed some variables and
	functions to make their names more menanigful.

2004-07-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c
	(gimp_histogram_editor_menu_update): set the active item of the
	combo-box after changing the visibility filter.

2004-07-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c (gimp_prop_boolean_combo_box_notify):
	same fix as below.

2004-07-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c (gimp_prop_enum_combo_box_notify):
	block gimp_prop_enum_combo_box_callback() before changing the
	combo-box.

2004-07-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c: only write aux-info for properties
	that have been changed from their default values.

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: some code cleanup.

2004-07-08  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.[ch]: added a "const gchar *format"
	parameter to gimp_selection_data_set_pixbuf() which selects the
	format in which to encode the pixbuf (was defaulting to "png"
	before).

	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.c: when copying, offer all formats which
	are savable with GdkPixbuf. Added a GimpClipboard struct which is
	attached to the Gimp and which stores all the persistent data
	needed by the clipboard. Renamed some private functions.

	(unfortunately this change breaks pasting to AbiWord:
	 http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7068)

2004-07-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	* app/config/gimpconfig-deserialize.c
	* app/config/gimpconfig-serialize.c: removed redundant casts.

	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.[ch]: added convenience functions to
	get and set aux-info based on object properties.

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: use the new functions to save
	a histogram's channel and scale in the sessionrc.

2004-07-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.c: sort the list of pixbuf formats so
	that PNG is the preferred format and GIF and JPEG come last.

2004-07-07  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/*.[ch]: Use single centralized functions to
	create, load, and save objects, instead of separate functions
	for each type of object. A few other miscellaneous fixes.

2004-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.[ch]: changed to allow pasting any
	GdkPixbuf supported format (makes pasting from OpenOffice
	work). Cleaned up a bit to perpare pasting of SVG data.

2004-07-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_new_from_tiles): add an alpha
	channel if the src tile-manager doesn't have one. Warn on
	unsupported type conversions instead of silently doing the wrong
	thing. Fixes bug #145482.

	* app/core/gimpbuffer.c: cosmetics.

2004-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/clipboard.[ch]: removed...

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpclipboard.[ch]: ...and added here.

	* app/actions/edit-commands.c
	* app/gui/gui.c: changed accordingly.

2004-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Made the undo system robust against the currently pushed undo
	being too large according to prefs settings. Fixes bug #145379.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo.[ch] (gimp_image_undo_push_undo)
	(gimp_image_undo_group_end): emit "undo-event" *before* calling
	gimp_image_undo_free_space() so the undo history doesn't try to
	remove an item that has never been added.

	(gimp_image_undo_push_undo): added boolean return value indicating
	if the undo could be pushed (FALSE means the undo was to large
	and was discarded right away).

	(gimp_image_undo_push_item): return NULL if the above returned
	FALSE.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (gimp_image_undo_push_text_layer):
	changed accordingly.

2004-07-07  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Don't try to load EXIF data if any warnings
	happened, cause that likely means corruption and libexif doesn't
	handle that very happily. Addresses bug #145212. Perhaps the error and
	warning messages should be propagated to the user in the GUI somehow,
	currently they are not.

2004-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c (edit_actions): added "..." to "Clear
	undo history" because it has a confirmation dialog.

	* app/actions/edit-commands.c: cleanup: moved static functions to
	the end of the file and prototyped them.

2004-07-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogramview.c (gimp_histogram_view_expose):
	fixed a drawing bug I introduced earlier today.

2004-07-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: added actions and callbacks for
	scrolling the view. Not used in menus but useful for controllers.

2004-07-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	(gimp_edit_selection_tool_key_press): adapt the arrow key velocity
	to the display scale factor. Please test and complain if you
	dislike this behaviour.

	* themes/Default/images/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/stock-color-pick-from-screen-16.png: new
	icon drawn by Jimmac.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.[ch]: register the new icon.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimppickbutton.c: use it for the screen color
	picker instead of reusing the color picker tool icon.

2004-07-06  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/*.[ch]:  a bunch of code clean-up and
	debugging.  Created "classes" for the objects, and
	attached functions to classes rather than objects.

2004-07-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Added an RGB histogram based on a patch by Tor Lillqvist. Fixes
	bug #145401.

	* app/base/base-enums.[ch]: added GIMP_HISTOGRAM_RGB, don't export
	it to the PDB.

	* app/base/gimphistogram.c: implemented histogram functions for
	the RGB mode.

	* app/base/levels.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolorbar.c
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: handle the new enum value.

	* app/widgets/gimphistogramview.c: for GIMP_HISTOGRAM_RGB mode,
	draw a histogram that shows the RGB channels simultaneously

2004-07-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpmodule/gimpmodule.c: comply with C99 aliasing rules.

2004-07-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_menu_position)
	(gimp_button_menu_position): call gtk_menu_set_monitor() only
	for GTK+ < 2.4.4 and added a #warning about it.

2004-07-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist: applied patch from Shlomi Fish that
	fixes confusion of filenames and user-visible object names (bug
	#132621). Also removed function remove_trailing_whitespace() that
	used to duplicate functionality from GLib and updated
	preset_create_filename().

2004-07-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppreviewrenderer.c
	(gimp_preview_renderer_set_viewable): queue an idle update when
	setting the viewable to NULL so the view gets cleared correctly.

	(gimp_preview_renderer_idle_update): call
	gimp_preview_renderer_update() even if renderer->viewable is NULL
	so clearing the viewable gets propagated to the GUI.

	Moved clearing the viewable and removing the idle from
	GObject::finalize() to GObject::dispose() because calling
	set_viewable() with a NULL viewable triggers typechecking casts
	and queuing idle functions, which is not nice in finalize().

2004-07-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/Makefile.am (libcdisplay_proof_la_LIBADD): added back
	$(LCMS_LIBS) that I had accidentally removed.

2004-07-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c (gimp_vectors_tree_view_drag_svg):
	return the proper type.

2004-07-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c: connect to
	"editing-canceled" of the name cell renderer and restore the
	original text in the callback. Doesn't work reliably until GTK+
	bug #145463 is fixed.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-rc.c (plug_in_icon_deserialize): fixed a
	compiler warning.

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: removed some redundant casts and other
	trivial cleanups.

2004-07-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.h: removed #define
	GIMP_CONTROLLER_PARAM_SERIALIZE.

	* libgimpmodule/gimpmoduletypes.h: added
	GIMP_MODULE_PARAM_SERIALIZE instead.

	* modules/controller_midi.c: changed accordingly.

	* modules/cdisplay_colorblind.c
	* modules/cdisplay_gamma.c
	* modules/cdisplay_highcontrast.c
	* modules/cdisplay_proof.c: made the new properties serializable.

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am (enum_headers): don't scan
	app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-types.h for enums.

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-types.h: removed /*< pdb-skip >*/

	* app/core/core-types.h: reordered opaque typedefs to somehow
	match the categories in the comments.

2004-07-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-types.h: removed enum SizeType.

	* app/text/text-enums.h: added it as enum GimpSizeType and added
	comment that it's for backward compatibility only.

	* tools/pdbgen/Makefile.am
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* libgimp/gimpenums.h
	* plug-ins/pygimp/gimpenums.py
	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-constants.c
	* tools/pdbgen/enums.pl: regenerated (pdbgen insisted on
	reordering the enums).

2004-07-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-types.h: #define MIN and MAX values for
	GimpCoords.pressure, .tilt and .wheel.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_get_event_coords)
	(gimp_display_shell_get_device_coords): use the #defines instead
	of hardcoded magic values when CLAMP()ing event or device values.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/Makefile.am: link all modules with libgimpmodule.

2004-07-05  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: improved defaults.  use gimp_invert()
	instead of rolling own.  Use nasty hack to get previews to
	work with grayscale images.  Accept grayscale images.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdata.[ch] (gimp_data_create_filename): Removed the
	basename parameter and use the object name instead. Convert it to
	the filesystem encoding.

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c: changed accordingly.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist: applied patch from Shlomi Fish that
	fixes a number of bugs in the gimpressionst plug-in (bug #145309).

	Also added some const qualifiers, cleaned up includes and removed
	degtorad() and radtodeg() functions that used to duplicate
	functionality from libgimpmath.

2004-07-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateview.c
	(gimp_template_view_tree_name_edited): removed unused local variables.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.c: don't g_free() a GdkPixbuf, it's an
	object. Removed trailing whitespace.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c (draw_background): fixed declaration.

2004-07-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcolorizetool.c (gimp_colorize_tool_initialize):
	return TRUE if initialization was successful. Makes the
	tool->drawable pointer being set correctly by the calling code and
	fixes bugs where colorize was leaving the drawable in a modified
	but non-undoable state when cancelling or changing images.

2004-07-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/cdisplay_proof.c: use object properties for the
	configurable values.

2004-07-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpchannel.[ch]: added signal "color-changed" and emit
	it in gimp_channel_set_color() and gimp_channel_set_opacity().

	* app/core/gimpimage-qmask.[ch]: added new functions
	gimp_image_set,get_qmask_color().

	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: install a "color-changed" handler on
	gimage->channels and update gimage->qmask_color when the qmask's
	color changes. Fixes bug #145361.

	* app/actions/qmask-commands.c: use the new qmask color API.

2004-07-04  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/dialogs-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdeviceinfo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_selection.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradients.pdb: Small changes to make GIMP
	CVS compile with gcc 2.95 again. Mostly double semicolons and
	variable declarations after other stuff. Spotted by Martin
	Renold.

	* app/pdb/gradients_cmds.c: regenerated.

	(there is one issue left, see his patch at
	http://old.homeip.net/martin/gcc-2.95.diff, I did not
	copy the #define va_copy __va_copy, since I don't know
	what happens here.)

2004-07-04  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-dialog.[ch]:
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.[ch]:
	* plug-ins/gfig/notes.txt:       New files.
	* plug-ins/gfig/*.[ch]:  Complete reworking of the gfig plug-in.
	See 'notes.txt' for a summary of what has changed, and how to use
	it now.  Plenty of bugs have been  introduced, which will take a
	while to straighten out.

2004-07-04  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-equalize.c (gimp_drawable_equalize): Drop
	a couple of unused variables.

2004-07-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpmodule/gimpmodule.[ch]: added gimp_module_register_enum(),
	a function to register an enum type for a GTypeModule.

	* modules/cdisplay_colorblind.c: use an object property for the
	color deficiency enum.

2004-07-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/channel_mixer.c: don't attempt to store a

2004-07-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcontext.[ch]: added context->serialize_props mask
	which enables specifying exactly which properties will be
	serialized. Also fixes a bug that prevented undefined properties
	from being serialized, breaking tool_options and device status
	serialization.

	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.c (gimp_tool_info_new): make only the
	properties in the tool_info->context_props mask serializable, also
	configure/initialize tool_info->tool_options.

	* app/tools/gimp-tools.c (gimp_tools_register): removed
	tool_options initialization that is now done in
	gimp_tool_info_new().

	* app/widgets/gimpdeviceinfo.c: make only the properties in
	GIMP_DEVICE_INFO_CONTEXT_MASK serializable.

	* app/widgets/gimpdevicestatus.c: add the device table to its
	parent container again. Fixes "missing" devices.

2004-07-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c: don't let the Paste menu items

	fixed the implementation.

2004-07-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/gimpressionist/*.[ch]: applied patch from Shlomi Fish
	that massively cleans up gimppressionist (touching all files and
	addding some new ones) and adds a simple PDB interface for
	selecting one of the previously created presets.
	Fixes bugs #145191, #144913 and #144922.

2004-07-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 2.1.2.

2004-07-01  Michael Schumacher  <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/blend-anim.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/glossy.scm

	gimp_selection_data_[get|set]_pixbuf().

2004-07-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfgbgarea.[ch]: implement GtkWidget::drag_motion()
	and set the FG/BG depending on where the color was dropped. Also
	set the drag status accordingly so the cursor indicates whether
	dropping will have an effect or not. Fixes bug #145219.

2004-07-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimptemplate.c: do like Liam taught us and use the
	golden ratio as default for new images.

2004-06-30  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_cursor_update):
	Chain up if the color tool is enabled. This fixes the problem of
	the color picker cursor not appearing when using a paint tool
	in color picking mode while "Show Paint Tool Cursor" is off.

2004-06-30  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c: moved call to
	_gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable() from gimp_drawable_detach() to
	gimp_drawable_flush(), to resolve problem described in bug
	#145051.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	intended to fix bug #141971.

2004-06-30  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/*/*-enums.h: did HIG-compliant capitalization in the right
	place, instead of the auto-generated *-enums.c files.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.[ch]

2004-06-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/maze/maze_face.c: made the dialog look a little less
	clumsy.

2004-06-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/drawable.pdb
	* libgimp/gimppixbuf.c: raised the maximum size for thumbnails
	from 256 to 512 pixels.

	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpdrawable_pdb.c: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: redone Bill's fix using
	gimp_image_get_thumbnail(). A lot simpler, renders the alpha
	checkerboard and also works for grayscale images.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fixed a 1.2 -> 2.0 regression that was forgotten:

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]: added enum GimpColorPickState
	which can be one of { NEW, UPDATE }.

	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.[ch]: changed #if 0'ed function
	gimp_palette_editor_update_color() to
	gimp_palette_editor_pick_color() and restored the functionality of
	creating/updating colors via this API

	Changed button_press handler to only edit the color on double
	click if it's really a double click on the same color.
	Fixes bug #141381.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickeroptions.[ch]: added boolean property
	"add-to-palette" and a GUI for it.

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list
	* app/tools/gimpcolortool.[ch]: added a GimpColorPickState
	parameter to the "color_picked" signal. Pass NEW on button_press
	and UPDATE on motion.

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c (gimp_curves_tool_color_picked)
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c (gimp_levels_tool_color_picked)
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_color_picked):
	changed accordingly

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c (gimp_color_picker_tool_picked):
	If "add-to-palette" is TRUE, get the palette editor and call
	gimp_palette_editor_pick_color().

2004-06-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.[ch]: renamed the SVG related
	functions so that they deal with an anonymous data stream that
	could as well be a PNG image.

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.[ch]
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: use gsize for the length of
	the buffer.

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.[ch]
	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]: added GIMP_DND_TYPE_PNG which isn't
	used yet.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette.[ch] (gimp_palette_add_entry): take
	const GimpRGB* instead of just GimpRGB*.
	Converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* widgets/gimpselectiondata.[ch] (gimp_selection_data_get_svg):
	changed return value from gchar* to const gchar*. Renamed
	parameters to be consistent with other SVG functions.

	* widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.c
	* widgets/gimpdnd.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-30  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpstroke.[ch]
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: Applied a modified patch from
	Geert Jordaens that implements the gimp-path-get-point-at-dist
	PDB function (fixes bug #138754).

	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-06-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (gimp_toolbox_button_accel_changed):
	do like GtkAccelLabel does and turn underscores in accels into
	spaces so e.g. "Page_Up" becomes "Page Up".

2004-06-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: reordered drop destinations
	so vectors are preferred over SVG.

	* app/vectors/gimpvectors-import.[ch]: added "gint position"
	parameter to all import functions so the imported vectors can be
	added at any position in the vectors stack.

	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: changed accordingly (pass -1 as
	position).

	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: implemented SVG DND from and
	to the paths dialog.

2004-06-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.c: don't free the SVG data
	after dropping, it's owned by GtkSelectionData.

2004-06-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c: use gtk_target_list_add() instead of
	gtk_target_list_add_table() because the latter prepends the
	targets to the internal list which screws the order (== priority)
	of DND targets.

	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.c: added some more checks for
	failed drops (selection_data->length < 0).

2004-06-29  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: The preview's row buffer was
	accidentally made way too large.

2004-06-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_get_mod_string() which takes a GdkModifierType and returns
	correctly formated strings for all shift,control,alt combinations.

	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilloptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickeroptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpconvolvetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcropoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpdodgeburntool.c
	* app/tools/gimperasertool.c
	* app/tools/gimpflipoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpmagnifyoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpmoveoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectoroptions.c
	* app/widgets/gimpchanneltreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.c: use the new function instead
	of gimp_get_mod_name_shift(),control(),alt(),separator(). This
	kindof addresses the issue of configurable modifier keys but is
	actually indended to ease translation of format strings ("%s" is
	easier to get right than "%s%s%s").

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Allow all sorts of things to be dropped on or in between the
	items of a GimpContainerTreeView:

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.[ch]: added more parameters to
	GimpContainerTreeView::drop_possible() to specify where ecactly
	the drop should take place (between or into items) and to support
	dropping all sorts of things.

	Renamed ::drop() to ::drop_viewable() and added ::drop_color(),
	::drop_files() and ::drop_svg(), which cover all possible drop
	types.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview-dnd.[ch]: changed accordingly.
	Dispatch all kinds of drops to the resp. virtual functions.

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c: allow to drop URIs, colors
	and patterns to the layers dialog. Fixes bugs #119506 and #139246.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/file/file-open.[ch] (file_open_layer): new utility function
	which opens an image, flattens it if needed and returns the only
	layer, converted for a passed destination image.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	(gimp_display_shell_drop_files): use the new function.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/gimpselectiondata.[ch]: new files containing the
	code which encodes/decodes all sorts of stuff to/from its
	GtkSelectionData representation. Used to live in gimpdnd.c

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c: use the new functions (unclutters the
	file quite a bit), converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c:
	#include "libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h"

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fixed bug #141930 while keeping bug #132322 fixed:

	* app/base/curves.c (curves_lut_func)
	* app/base/levels.c (levels_lut_func): changed meaning of channel
	slots for GRAYA images: just as for GRAY images, expect the value
	channel in slot 0 and the alpha channel in slot 1, so it matches
	the meaning of slots of GimpHistogram (before this change, only
	GRAY images had their value in slot 0 and GRAYA images had it in
	slot 1, whereas the histogram had the value channel in slot 0,
	which was breaking auto levels for GRAYA images).

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/color.pdb: adjusted channel fiddling for GRAY
	and GRAYA images accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c (curves_update)
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c (levels_update): call
	gimp_color_bar_set_buffers() with the right buffers.

	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_initialize_after_callback): select the
	standard tool.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: cosmetics.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: reverted fix for bug #141930. These
	hacks are there because the enum used in levels doesn't match
	the enum used by the combo box and the histogram widget.

2004-06-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c (gimp_clone_tool_button_release):
	removed again (tools must not draw outside GimpDrawTool::draw()).

	(gimp_clone_tool_draw): removed check for gimp_draw_tool_is_active()
	because the draw function would not be called if the draw tool was
	inactive. Simplified check for whether or not to draw the src
	location.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_button_release):
	pause/resume the draw tool across all button_release actions so
	tools (clone) have a chance to draw different things depending on
	gimp_tool_control_is_active(tool->control). Fixes bug #145022.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_select_object): added missing
	return value.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: applied HIG rules to the GUI and slightly
	rearranged it to get a more compact layout. Applied GIMP coding
	style.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c: removed wrong note about using
	_gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable() from the API docs.

2004-06-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c (dog): ifdef'ed out calls to
	_gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable() since it can't be used from a
	plug-in. Removed trailing whitespace and redundant includes.

	* libgimp/gimp.def: removed _gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable again.

2004-06-28  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: fixed drawing code to properly
	update after deleting nodes via BackSpace/Delete.

2004-06-27  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c: removed two small chunks of code.
	Fixes bug #141930.  Possibly unfixes bug #132322.

2004-06-27  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: added _gimp_tile_cache_flush_drawable because
	it is used in a plug-in. See bug #145051.

2004-06-26  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: Preview now works correctly with
	RGBA and grayscale-alpha images. Fixes bug #144971.

2004-06-26  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c: added button_release callback
	to fix bug #145022.

2004-06-26  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: Use GTK_PREVIEW_GRAYSCALE if source
	is grayscale or grayscale-alpha. Partial fix for bug #144971.

2004-06-25  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: speed up preview by allocating tile
	cache before creating dialog.  Should fix bug #144972.

2004-06-25  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* plug-ins/common/zealouscrop.c: Moved Zealous Crop from
	<Image>/Layer/Crop to <Image>/Image/Crop because it affects the
	entire image.

2004-06-25  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/dog.c: added Difference of Gaussians edge
	detect plug-in.

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl:
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: added dog and regenerated
	Makefile.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: added GIMP_ACTION_SELECT_SET
	actions which set a generated brush's properties directly.

	* app/actions/context-commands.c: adjust the range of possible
	brush radius and aspect_ratio values to be actually usable.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]: reordered parameters and
	members to be consistent with other places where generated
	brushes are used. Check for errors when loading a brush and
	utf8-validate its name. Cleanup.

	* app/core/gimpbrush.c
	* app/core/gimpbrushpipe.c: cleanup.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): work around
	GTK+ bug #143270 (set the cursor on the selected model path
	instead of selecting the iter in the selection). Fixes random
	theme switching when selecting the "Theme" page.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.c: added properties for all brush
	parameters.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c: listen to property changes of the
	edited brush and update the scales accordingly.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: more work on the controller page,
	made integer controller properties editable.

	* modules/controller_midi.c: allow to specify the MIDI channel to
	generate events from. Default to -1 (all channels).

2004-06-24  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.[ch]:
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig-preview.c: Let gfig use a thumbnail of the
	image as background for its preview, if the image is RGB and "Show
	image" is checked in the Options tab.  (Next best thing to
	previewing in the image.)

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: added a boolean property
	"debug-events" and honor it when printing debugging output.
	Should add an event console window so the user doesn't need to
	have a terminal to inspect input module output.

	* app/gui/prefereces-dialog.c: HIGified some forgotten labels.
	Renamed the "Pointer Movement Feedback" frame to "Mouse Cursors".
	Replaced some forgotten "Dir" with "Folder".
	Made more GimpControllerInfo and GimpController properties
	editable and cleaned up the controller page.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.[ch]: added gimp_prop_label_new().

	* app/widgets/gimpgrideditor.c: HIGified capitalization.

2004-06-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* modules/controller_midi.c: remember the source ID returned by
	g_io_add_watch() and remove it when changing the device, so the
	file descritor gets actually closed. Minor cleanups.

2004-06-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.[ch]: renamed function
	gimp_controller_wheel_scrolled() to
	gimp_controller_wheel_scroll().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): changed accordingly.

2004-06-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: fix typo in wheel controller mapping.

2004-06-24  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: added boolean return value to
	GimpTool::key_press() which indicates if the event was handled.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: return TRUE if the key event was handled.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: removed key_press() implementation.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerkeyboard.[ch]: new controller class
	which takes GdkEventKey and emits controller events for all
	combinations of modifiers and cursor keys.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_controllers_get_keyboard().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: if a key event was not
	handled by the active tool, dispatch it to the keyboard controller.

	* etc/controllerrc: add a keyboard controller which is configured
	to do the same as the removed gimp_paint_tool_key_press().

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* libgimp/gimpdrawable.c:  added some documentation for
	a few important functions with no API docs.

2004-06-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.1.1 release.

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/actions/file-commands.c: make "Revert" only ask for
	confirmation if image is dirty.  Fixes bug #141971.

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/gui/*.c:
	* app/widgets/*.c:
	* etc/templaterc: HIGify capitalization.  Should finish bug #123699
	except for everything I missed or got wrong.

2004-06-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: commented out the linux_input controller
	configuration.

2004-06-23  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/*.c: HIGify capitalization for dialogs.  More
	progress on bug #123699.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c: added utility function midi_event()
	which assembles a GimpControllerEventValue and emits it.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpenumaction.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimppluginaction.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpstringaction.[ch]: added parameters to the
	gimp_*_action_selected() function so the "selected" signal can be
	emitted with value != action->value. Changed GtkAction::activate()
	implementations accordingly (pass action->value).

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: call gimp_enum_action_selected()
	and pass the value of the GimpControllerEventValue instead of
	temporarily replacing action->value and calling
	gtk_action_activate().

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: fixed debugging output.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: added signal "set-brush" which is
	G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST so we can connect before and after the default
	implementation. Moved the brush setting and outline invalidation
	stuff to its default implementation. Also remember the outline's
	width and height. Call gimp_brush_core_set_brush() from
	gimp_brush_core_invalidate_cache() so "set-brush" is emitted
	whenever a generated brush becomes dirty.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_button_press): don't
	pause/resume but rather stop/start the draw_tool. Fixes straight
	line preview aretefacts.

	(gimp_paint_tool_oper_update): set the brush_core's brush before
	starting the draw_tool.

	(gimp_paint_tool_draw): never free the brush_core's cached brush
	outline because the brush_core does that by itself now.

	(gimp_paint_tool_set_brush)
	(gimp_paint_tool_set_brush_after): new callbacks which pause and
	resume the draw_tool. Fixes brush outline artefacts when modifying
	the current brush e.g. by using the mouse wheel.

2004-06-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-commands.h: removed enum GimpContextSelectType.

	* app/actions/actions-types.h: added enum GimpActionSelectType.

	* app/actions/actions.[ch]: added utility functions
	action_select_value() and action_select_object().

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: merged the layer select
	callbacks into one using the GimpActionSelectType functions. Added
	actions and callbacks for modifying the active layer's opacity.

	* app/menus/menus-types.h: #incude "actions/action-types.h".

	* app/gui/gui-types.h: #incude "menus/menus-types.h".

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: allow to enable/disable input
	controllers.

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: try again to revert.

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: reverted.

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts: HIG-ified capitalization on
	all.  Finishes this for everything in plug-ins.  Bug #123699 is
	now mostly fixed.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite-regression.c: define timersub()
	macro in case it's undefined. Patch by Tim Mooney, fixes 'make
	check' on Tru64 (bug #144780).

2004-06-22  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c: added Store/Recall buttons for
	one-click saving and loading of curves.  Should create stock
	labels for them.  Hopefully resolves bug #75558.

2004-06-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: added actions & callbacks to
	configure the canvas padding color.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added the actions' help IDs and menu entries.

	* app/display/display-enums.h: added /*< skip >*/'ed enum value
	GIMP_CANVAS_PADDING_MODE_RESET.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: removed the canvas padding
	button and its popup menu (fixes bug #142996). Instead, added a
	toggle button which allows to zoom the image when the window is
	resized (as known from sodipodi, except it doesn't work as nice
	yet :-) improvements to the algorithm are welcome).
	Cleaned up the GimpDisplayShell struct a bit and renamed some
	of its members.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpstock.[ch]
	* themes/Default/images/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/stock-zoom-follow-window-12.png: added new
	icon for the new display toggle button.

2004-06-22  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c (gimp_clone_tool_draw): chain up
	unconditionally now that we draw the brush outline while
	painting. Fixes brush outline artefacts on button_press and
	button_release. Spotted by sjburges.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c (gimp_file_dialog_set_image): unset
	the filename if the image is unnamed.

	* configure.in
	* app/sanity.c: depend on gtk+ >= 2.4.1.

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.[ch]: changed gimp_thumb_box_set_uris()
	to gimp_thumb_box_take_uris() since the function takes ownership
	of the list,

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: changed accordingly. Removed code
	that worked around a problem in gtk+ < 2.4.1.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorarea.c (gimp_color_area_set_color): use
	gimp_rgb_distance() for flat color areas. Fixes bug #144786.

2004-06-22  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/fileops.pdb: app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c is a
	generated file, need to do the documentation change here.

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpfileops_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.c: use radio buttons
	for constraint options.  Makes all options visible,
	should resolve bug #68106.

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: to reduce clutter, hide overwrite
	query dialog after user has responded.

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/noisify.c: changed handling of alpha
	channel in an attempt to deal with bug #72853.
	Changed menu entry from "Noisify" to "Scatter RGB".

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/pdb/fileops_cmds.c: fixed incorrect documentation for
	gimp_file_load, which was the root cause of bug #118811.

2004-06-21  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins: finish implementing HIG capitalization in dialogs.
	Scripts remain to be done.  More progress on bug #123699.

2004-06-21  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch] (enum GimpCursorFormat): removed
	value GIMP_CURSOR_FORMAT_PIXBUF_PREMULTIPLY because it's the job
	of GDK to do that (it was GDK that was broken, not some of the X
	servers).

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c (gimp_cursor_new): premultiply the
	cursor's pixels for GTK+ < 2.4.4.

2004-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/gui.c (gui_exit_callback): improved message in quit
	dialog just in case that we don't manage to redo this dialog
	before 2.2.

2004-06-21  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.[ch]
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added new utility function
	gimp_label_set_attributes().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/gui/resolution-calibrate-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpviewabledialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c: use the new function.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainergridview.c
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: display the name in italic.

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: display the file size in italic.

2004-06-20  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/url.c: if url does not end in a recognized
	extension, open it as an unnamed image.  Fixes bug #118811.

2004-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrambox.[ch]: removed the label between the
	spinbuttons, it looks silly. Converted tabs to spaces, removed
	trailing whitespace.

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c
	* app/tools/gimpthresholdtool.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins:  changed dialogs to follow HIG capitalization style
	wherever they didn't.  Scripts remain to be done.  Partially
	fixes bug #123699.

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrambox.[ch]:
	* app/tools/gimpthresholdtool.c: Changed the threshold tool dialog
	so that it uses a two-triangle-slider scale of the sort used in the
	levels tool.  Almost all of the changes are actually in the
	histogram-box widget code, which is only used by the threshold
	tool.  Fixes bug #137521.

2004-06-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: removed redundant hboxes and other
	layout cleanups.

2004-06-20  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpnavigationview.[ch]:
	* app/actions/view-actions.c:
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]:
	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h:
	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: Changed "Zoom to Fit Window" command
	to "Fit Image in Window" and added another command, "Fit Image
	to Window", that zooms according to the opposite dimension. Fixes
	bug #144597.

2004-06-19  Michael Schumacher  <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.def: added missing
	gimp_controller_* entries

2004-06-19  Michael Schumacher  <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c: #ifdef G_OS_WIN32 for an O_NONBLOCK

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: more changes to save dialog.  Moved
	comment field to Advanced area.  Don't set restart marker
	frequency stuff insensitive.  Changed range for quality
	scale from 0-1 to 0-100 to follow the jpeg spec (but left
	allowable range for pdb at 0-1 to avoid breaking anything).

2004-06-19  Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c: fixed my fix for bug # 68106, which
	worked incorrectly for two of the control points.

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_midi.c (midi_read_event): simplified
	swallowing of SysEx messages and unwanted data bytes. Reordered
	and commented stuff to be more readable.

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* modules/Makefile.am
	* modules/controller_midi.c: new controller for MIDI input. Maps
	all note on and note off events and all MIDI controllers to
	GimpContollerEvents. Should parse any MIDI stream. Code based on
	blinkenmedia stuff from Daniel Mack.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Applied a patch from Geert Jordaens that implements the
	GtkStatusbar functionality in GimpStatusbar so that we can redo it
	in order to fix bug #120175:

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list: added VOID: UINT, STRING.

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: copied GtkStatusbar code.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose_utils.c (create_brush): use
	G_SQRT2; some coding style cleanups.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c (arcto_ellipsesegment): moved
	array initialization out of variable declaration (bug #144632).

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c (arcto_ellipsesegment): use
	G_SQRT2 to make circlemagic a constant value so we can initialize
	the array on declaration. Fixes bug #144632.

2004-06-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* devel-docs/parasites.txt: document "exif-data" parasite.

2004-06-18  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: Don't use deprecated gimp_text functions,
	clean up font name string handling a bit, default is now "Monospace"
	instead of "Courier".

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c (gimp_controllers_event_mapped):
	start supporting GIMP_CONTROLLER_EVENT_VALUE of type gdouble.
	Assume the double value is in a [0.0..1.0] range and temporarily
	change the value of the called GimpEnumAction to a range of
	[0..1000] when invoking it. All still very hackish...

2004-06-19  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c (gimp_controller_info_event):
	more debugging output.

2004-06-18 Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c: changed algorithm for scaling when
	aspect ratio is constrained, to fix strange behavior described
	in bug # 68106.

2004-06-18 Bill Skaggs  <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c:  redid save dialog along lines suggested
	in bug # 138929

	Only create an exif data parasite on loading file if the file actually
	contains exif data.

	Call exif data parasite "exif-data" instead of "jpeg-exif-data",
	because it should be interchangeable with TIFF exif data.

2004-06-18  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added tons of new actions to
	modify the current FG/BG color's RGB components.

	Added new enum value GIMP_CONTEXT_SELECT_SET which allows to set
	values, not only increase/decrease them.

	Changed context_select_value() utility function to interpret
	GimpEnumAction::value being >= GIMP_CONTEXT_SELECT_SET as settings
	in a range from 0 to 1000. Yes, that's a hack...

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: reverted my fix to bug #144570.

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimpfuzzyselecttool.c: Fix fuzzy select menu label.

2004-06-18  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c (gimp_transform_tool_bounds):
	If transforming a path, use the path bounds rather than the mask
	bounds. Fixes bug #144570.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch]: added gimp_boolean_handled_accum().

	* app/core/gimp.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: use it.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcontainer.c (gimp_container_deserialize): add newly
	created children to the container *after* deserializing them so
	GimpContainer::add() callbacks get the already deserialized
	object.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: connect to "add" and "remove" of
	the controller list and remember / clear the wheel controller when
	it appears / disappears.

2004-06-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: check for xsltproc and mention that the intltool
	version mismatch is harmless.

2004-06-17  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: Fix typos and improve documentation.
	Addresses bug #144267.

	* app/pdb/paths_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimppaths_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: removed "enabled"
	property. Removed GIMP_CONTROLLER_PARAM_SERIALIZE from the "name"
	property because it's the hardware-determined name of this
	controller instance.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: set the name.

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h: #include gimpcontroller.h.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: added "enabled" here
	instead.  Don't dispatch events if the controller is
	disabled. Made everything work (not crash) with info->mapping
	being NULL.

	* etc/controllerrc: updated again with the changed format.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: added
	gimp_controllers_get_list() which returns the container of
	controllers.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added controller configuration
	(can't change anything yet, just view the current settings).
	Resurrected the "Input Devices" page and removed the "Session"
	page by moving its widgets to other pages. Pack the various
	"Save now"/"Clear now" buttons vertically, not horizontally.
	Fixes bug #139069.

	* themes/Default/images/preferences/Makefile.am
	* themes/Default/images/preferences/controllers.png
	* themes/Default/images/preferences/theme.png: new icons for new
	prefs pages. Someone needs to make them nice...

2004-06-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c: GtkUIManager makes the menu bar
	visible by default, hide it if options->show_menubar is FALSE.
	Fixes bug #143243.

2004-06-17  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.1.1. Allow to disable the
	build of the linux_input controller module.

2004-06-17  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Make transforms (most
	notably perspective transforms) conform exactly to specified
	edges. Includes a patch by David Gowers. Fixes bug #144352.

2004-06-16  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: put BTN_{WHEEL,GEAR_DOWN,GEAR_UP}
	usage in #ifdefs, since pre-2.6 kernels do not have them.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c (linux_input_read_event): n_bytes
	should be a gsize.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/context-actions.c
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added actions & callback
	to select the first/last/prev/next tool.

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: removed BTN_MISC,
	since it is the same as BTN_0 in the input.h header file.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.c (gimp_controller_get_event_name)
	(gimp_controller_get_event_blurb): always return a non-NULL
	string (return "<invalid event id>" as fallback).

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: reenabled button event
	dispatching.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c: fixed debugging output.

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: break out of the
	loop after we handled the first matching rel_event.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added #define
	GIMP_CONTROLLER_PARAM_SERIALIZE. Made all properties serializable.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: made "device-name"
	serializable.

	* app/config/gimpconfig-params.h: added macro
	GIMP_CONFIG_INSTALL_PROP_POINTER() which needs to be handled
	by custom (de)serialize_property() implementations.

	* app/config/gimpconfig-deserialize.c
	* app/config/gimpconfig-serialize.c: made object (de)serialization
	work for object properties which are *not* GIMP_PARAM_AGGREGATE.
	Write/parse the exact type of the object to create to enable this.

	* app/core/gimpmarshal.list: new marshaller for GimpControllerInfo.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: implement GimpConfigInterface
	and add "controller" and "mapping" properties. Add "event-mapped"
	signal which carries the action_name.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: removed all deserialization code
	and simply (de)serialize the controller container. Install a
	container handler for "event-mapped" and do the action_name ->
	action mapping in the callback.

	* etc/controllerrc: regenerated with new syntax. Delete your old one!

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	(gimp_controller_wheel_get_event_name): don't use gettext() here.

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: added more button events, set
	the device name, some cleanup.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl: changed dependencies for blur.

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am: regenerated.

2004-06-16  Bill Skaggs <weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu>

	* plug-ins/common/blur.c: removed randomize and repeat options;
	made to run without popping a dialog.  (bug #142318)

2004-06-16  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: enable dial-events for
	e.g. the powermate. Fixed typo.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added missing menu entries (bug #144449).

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added
	GimpController::get_event_blurb() which returns the strings that
	were returned by get_event_name(). The latter returns
	untranslatable event identifiers now.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c
	* modules/controller_linux_input.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: changed the event mapping from
	event-id -> action-name to event-name -> action-name.

	* etc/controllerrc: changed accordingly (finally readable now).

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerinfo.[ch]: made an object out of
	the GimpControllerInfo struct.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-16  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* etc/controllerrc: fix typo

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* modules/controller_linux_input.c
	* etc/controllerrc: preliminary wheel event support.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: better debugging output.

2004-06-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: bug fix.

	* configure.in: check for linux/input.h.

	* modules/Makefile.am

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* etc/controllerrc: use the 10% actions for opacity.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.c: ref the actions when putting
	them in the mapping table.

	* app/actions/context-actions.c: added actions to change the
	opacity in 10% steps.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: added a "name" property.
	Dispatch events only if the controller is enabled.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.c: added controller events for
	all possible modifier combinations.

	* etc/Makefile.am
	* etc/controllerrc: default controllerrc which maps all unused
	wheel+modifier combinations to more-or-less usefull stuff.

2004-06-16  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Started to fix bug #106920 in a more genreral way:

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetsmarshal.list
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcontroller.[ch]: new abstract base class
	which provides an API for pluggable input controller modules
	(mouse wheel, usb/midi stuff etc.).

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollerwheel.[ch]: subclass of the above
	which maps wheel mouse scroll events to controller events.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontrollers.[ch]: manager for controllers.
	reads $(gimpdir)/controllerrc and keeps a mapping of controller
	events to GtkActions.

	* app/gui/gui.c: initialize and shut down the controller stuff.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): if a wheel controller
	exists, dispatch GdkEventScroll to it first and return if it was
	handled.

2004-06-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/text_tool.pdb: deprecate the XLFD-based API
	gimp_text() and gimp_text_get_extents().

	* app/pdb/text_tool_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimptexttool_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-06-15  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdbgen.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl: some simplistic code to add a $deprecated
	flag to pdb definitions, which translates into GIMP_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
	guards in lib headers.

2004-06-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/context-actions.[ch]
	* app/actions/context-commands.[ch]: added new action group to
	modify all GimpContext properties. So far there are actions to
	cycle through the lists of brushes, patterns etc., to change the
	opacity, to swap and default colors and to edit generated brushes.

	* app/actions/actions.c: register the new "context" action group.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c
	* app/actions/tools-commands.[ch]: removed "tools-default-colors"
	and "tools-swap-colors" actions and callbacks because they are
	in the "context" action group now.

	* app/menus/menus.c: add the "context" group to the <Image> and
	<Dock> UI managers.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: changed accordingly. Added a temporary
	"Context" menu to test and debug the new actions.

2004-06-15  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c (crop_selection_callback): Force
	aspect ratio to match selection when 'From Selection' is clicked.
	Fixes bug #144361. Also converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (respin_cmap): applied the fix for empty
	colormaps (bug #143009) here as well.

2004-06-15  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Don't round texture
	coordinates when not using interpolation. Fixes bug #144352 for
	the nearest neighbor case only.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimpinkoptions.c: replaced some arbitrary values with
	larger but still arbitrary values (default and limit for ink size).

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: removed PRETRACE_PAINT and
	POSTTRACE_PAINT from the GimpPaintCoreState enum. Removed
	"gboolean traces_on_window" from GimpPaintCoreClass.

	* app/paint/gimpclone.[ch]
	* app/paint/gimpink.c
	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: ditto. Show the brush outline
	while painting. Fixes bug #118348.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: use gimp_draw_tool_is_active()
	instead of GIMP_IS_DISPLAY(draw_tool->gdisp).

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c (gimp_action_group_add_*_actions):
	do the workaround for "" accelerators only if the GTK+ version
	is smaller than 2.4.3. Fixes bug #144342 for GTK+ >= 2.4.3.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c: declared
	gimp_drawable_transform_cubic() as inline function. Makes
	sample_cubic() run about 10% faster and causes a 7% speedup on
	cubic transformations.

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c (border_region): avoid an
	unnecessary memory allocation.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Disable preview in corrective
	mode, and notify preview when switching transform type and
	direction.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: added new virtual function
	GimpPaintCore::post_paint() and call it after calling
	GimpPaintCore::paint().

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.[ch]: renamed brush_core->grr_brush
	to brush_core->main_brush and reset brush_core->brush
	to brush_core->main_brush in GimpPaintCore::post_paint().

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c
	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-stroke.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c: removed all code which restores
	the brush_core's old brush after painting since post_paint()
	does this automatically now.

	* app/paint/gimpclone.[ch]: moved static variables to the
	GimpClone struct.

2004-06-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h (color_pixels): some code
	cleanup I did while attempting to optimize this code further.

2004-06-14  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.c: let extensions run synchronously when
	called via PDB. Fixes bug #140112.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Preview is now only used for
	layer transformations.

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c: removed calls to
	gimp_transform_tool_expose_preview() from all
	GimpTransformTool::motion() implementations...

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: ...and call it after calling
	tr_tool_class->preview().

2004-06-14  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: remember the last used
	GimpCursorFormat so changing the format in prefs applies
	instantly, and not after the next tool change.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimptoolcontrol.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpclonetool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcolortool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: s/GdkCursorType/GimpCursorType/g

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c (gimp_transform_tool_doit): Preview
	wasn't being turned off before performing a transformation. Also
	converted tabs to spaces.

2004-06-14  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: Transformation previews now
	use the selection mask if it is present.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Make sure PangoFT2 is using a recent enough fontconfig
	since many people have broken and confused setups.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_edit.pdb: cleans ups so generated
	output doesn't warn about uninitialize variable use, and whitespace
	cosmetic cleanups.

	* app/pdb/gradient_edit_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-06-13  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/base/cpu-accel.c: Reorged, to address bug #142907 and
	bug #143069. Accel implementations #define HAVE_ACCEL, and cpu_accel()
	keys on that. Both PPC and X86 implementations check for __GNUC__.
	X86 stuff is only used with USE_MMX is defined. The SSE OS check
	is now checked in arch_accel(), not cpu_accel(). Finally, the
	arch x86_64 checks now are EM64T aware (which didn't matter in
	practice).

2004-06-13  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.c: use drawable_mask_bounds()
	for texture coordinates instead of the drawable's width and height.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.c (shapeburst_region): don't call
	tile_ewidth() three times from the inner loop.

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_get): don't call
	tile_size() twice on the same tile.

	* app/base/tile-private.h: added tile_size_inline(), an inline
	version of the tile_size() function.

	* app/base/tile-cache.c
	* app/base/tile-manager.c
	* app/base/tile-swap.c
	* app/base/tile.c: use tile_size_inline() from inside the tile
	subsystem.

2004-06-13  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpiscissorstool.c: Minor tweaks to two macros.
	Shouldn't change anything.

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/tool-zoom.png:
	* cursors/cursor-zoom.png: minor fsckup

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-burn.png: the burn tool doesn't really have an
	  inverted handle

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch] (shapeburst_region): added
	progress callback.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c: show a progress while calculating
	the Shapeburst. Not perfect but better than not showing any
	progress at all.

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.[ch]: added enum GimpCursorFormat
	which can be one of { BITMAP, PIXBUF, PIXBUF-PREMULTIPLY } to
	work around broken X servers.

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h: added GimpGuiConfig::cursor-format.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: added a GUI for the new option.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.[ch]: added cursor_format parameter
	to gimp_cursor_new() and _set().

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdialogfactory.c: pass an appropriate cursor_mode.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c: added missing semicolon.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Fixed incorrect logic that
	caused perfect-but-slow pointer tracking to be used in tools that
	don't request exact mode.

	* app/display/Makefile.am:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]:
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-preview.[ch]: added
	* app/tools/gimpperspectivetool.c:
	* app/tools/gimprotatetool.c:
	* app/tools/gimpscaletool.c:
	* app/tools/gimpsheartool.c:
	* app/tools/gimptransformoptions.[ch]:
	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.[ch]: Implemented live transformation
	previews, available through tool options. Fixes bug #108172.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-blend.c (gradient_render_pixel): inline
	the repeat functions.

	* app/core/gimpgradient.c: inline the curve functions.

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-zoom.png: make more transparent

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf
	* cursors/tool-blur.png
	* cursors/tool-bucket-fill.png
	* cursors/tool-dodge.png
	* cursors/tool-eraser.png
	* cursors/tool-hand.png: fix a few problems hidden by low opacity

2004-06-13  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* cursor/*png: updated the cursors

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf: added nice new antialiased
	cursor layers made by Jimmac.

2004-06-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette.c (gimp_palette_load): don't use the rather
	inefficient gimp_palette_add_entry() when loading a palette.

2004-06-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdata.[ch]: added "gint freeze_count" and
	gimp_data_freeze()/thaw() functions. Emit "dirty" only if
	freeze_count either is 0 or drops to 0.

	* app/core/gimpbrushgenerated.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpgradient.[ch]: removed freeze/thaw stuff that
	was duplicated in these two subclasses and use the new
	GimpData API instead.

	* app/widgets/gimpbrusheditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcolorbar.c (gimp_color_bar_expose): don't copy
	the first row onto itself.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: Make Enter/Return apply the
	transformation, Backspace/Delete resets the transformation.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Simplify the key_press callback.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: Make the Enter/Return key do
	the crop action.

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: Make the _key_press functions
	safe for non-arrow keys.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/composite/gimp-composite.[ch]: just some cleanup.

2004-06-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_events): ported some forgotten #if 0'ed
	GtkItemFactory stuff to GtkUIManager.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptool.[ch]: renamed the "arrow_key" member
	to "key_press", since it is now no longer about just the arrow
	keys.

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.h
	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c
	* app/tools/gimpselectiontool.c
	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c
	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c
	* app/tools/tool_manager.c: Changed accordingly.

2004-06-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_init): add
	the file DND destination before all others so the DND code will
	implicitly use its destination properties. Works around Konqueror
	offering only file MOVE, not COPY and fixes bug #144168.

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sample_colorize.c: reindented, some minor cleanup.

2004-06-12  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/tool_manager.[ch]: renamed
	tool_manager_arrow_key_active to tool_manager_key_press_active.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c: Also dispatch
	GDK_Return/KP_Enter/BackSpace/Delete to the tools, the
	"arrow_key" member of GimpTool probably should be renamed.

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c: Use Enter/Return to convert the
	current path to a selection, use Backspace/Delete to delete the
	currently active anchors in a path.

	Implemented on Jimmacs request - thanks to him and Iva for being
	a great host  :)

2004-06-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c (gimp_histogram_editor_init):
	set the initially selected channel on the histogram combobox.
	Fixes bug #144225.

2004-06-12  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.[ch]: renamed all "pressure-pressure"
	variables to "pressure-hardness".

	* app/paint/gimpairbrush.c:
	* app/tools/gimppaintoptions-gui.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpcolorarea.c: replaced destroy() by
	finalize(), converted tabs to spaces, cleanup.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c (gimp_thumb_box_new): line-wrap the
	filename label if it's too long instead of cutting it off.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h (enum GimpCursorModifier):
	s/GIMP_LAST_CURSOR_MODIFIER_ENTRY/GIMP_CURSOR_MODIFIER_LAST/.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: changed accordingly. Renamed struct
	GimpBitmapCursor to GimpCursor. More cleanup.

2004-06-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/image-actions.c
	* app/actions/image-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/layers-actions.c
	* app/actions/layers-commands.[ch]: made the
	"image-convert-rgb/grayscale/indexed" and the
	"layers-mask-apply/delete" actions GimpEnumActions and merged
	their callbacks.

2004-06-10  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: restored the 'Show Paint Tool
	Cursor' option that was removed during clean-up.

2004-06-10  Philip Lafleur  <plafleur@cvs.gnome.org>

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_pressurize_mask):
	avoided some redundant calculations.

2004-06-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.c: removed the monitor calibration
	from the user installation process. It's not a vital setting and
	can be done from the Preferences dialog later.

	* app/gui/resolution-calibrate-dialog.[ch]: simplified the
	resolution calibration dialog by removing the hacks that were
	needed for drawing it in the user-installation style.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: changed accordingly. Also removed
	the separator from the Display page.

2004-06-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.[ch]: added an API to
	expand/collapse the "Advanced Options" frame.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: applied a patch done by William
	Skaggs that cleans up and reorganizes the Preferences dialog
	(bug #144060).

2004-06-09  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcoords.[ch]: renamed gimp_coords_length2 to
	gimp_coords_length_squared.

	* app/vectors/gimpbezierstroke.c: Changed accordingly

2004-06-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppenciltool.c (gimp_pencil_tool_init): no need to
	request GIMP_MOTION_MODE_EXACT here since the parent class does
	that already.

	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c (gimp_ink_tool_init): ditto. Enable the
	color picker feature for the ink tool.

2004-06-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: added "Selection Editor" to the
	Selection menu. Still hoping for the great menu reorganization
	though...

	* app/actions/select-actions.c (select_actions_update): "Save to
	Channel" makes sense without a selection also, so don't set it
	insensitive.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: the glob(3) function is not available on
	Win32 and also isn't necessarily UTF-8 safe. Started to add an
	alternative implementation. Right now there's just some code taken
	from GTK+ (an UTF-8 save fnmatch() implementation) and the plug-in
	does nothing useful. I will add some stripped-down glob code based
	on the code in glibc later.

2004-06-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_set_tiles): don't set
	layer->mask's offsets. It is wrong because GimpDrawable::set_tiles()
	is a lowlevel function which is used by stuff like scale and
	resize which keep the mask in sync explicitely and don't expect it
	to be moved in the middle of chaining up. Fixes bug #143860.

2004-06-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/view-actions.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.[ch]: added separate callback for
	"view-zoom-other" and connect GtkAction::activate manually so
	"Other..." can be selected even if it's the active item in the
	zoom radio group. Fixes bug #143850.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tileit.c (tileit_dialog): fixed a typo.

2004-06-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_setup): sort the menus
	by the translated menu path stripped from underscores.

2004-06-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (gauss): fixed a stupid cut'n'paste bug
	I introduced yesterday.

2004-06-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c (query): register the menu entry the new
	way and install a mnemonic for Gaussian Blur.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/curve_bend.c: applied a patch from Henrik Brix
	Andersen that tells the user that Curve Bend cannot operate on
	layers with masks instead of silently applying the mask
	(bug #134748).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/gauss_iir.c
	* plug-ins/common/gauss_rle.c: removed the two gaussian blur
	plug-ins...

	* plug-ins/common/gauss.c: and added a merged version done by
	William Skaggs. Fixes bug #134088.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/sgi/sgi.c: applied a patch from Philip Lafleur that
	makes the plug-in handle images with more than 4 channels. At the
	moment the extra information is discarded (bug #143673).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/unsharp.c: applied a modified patch from Geert
	Jordaens that adds a preview to the Unsharp Mask plug-in. Fixes
	bug #140974.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.c
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch]: applied a patch from Philip
	Lafleur that changes the way that paint is applied during a paint
	stroke. Fixes bug #124225.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/glob.c: added a simple glob plug-in based on
	some old code by George Hartz. This plug-in is very useful when
	you need to do batch processing, especially from Script-Fu.
	Fixes bug #143661.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c: applied a patch from David
	Gowers that makes the gradient editor display the perceptual
	intensity of the color under the cursor (bug #135037).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/snoise.c: applied a modifed patch from Yeti that
	adds a preview to the Solid Noise plug-in (bug #142587).

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/tiff.c: save the proper value for type of alpha
	channel. Fixes bug #143522; patch by Philip Lafleur.

2004-06-05  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c (prefs_dialog_new): update call
	to prefs_spin_button_add for num-processors too.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-scripts.c (script_fu_interface):
	left align toggle buttons.

2004-06-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimptextlayer-transform.[ch]: updated the (still unused)
	text transformation code.

	* app/text/gimptext-bitmap.c: removed a redundant transformation.

2004-06-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/Makefile.am
	* cursors/cursor-none.png
	* cursors/xbm/cursor-none.xbm: new empty cursor images.

	* app/config/gimpdisplayconfig.[ch]
	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h
	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h
	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimppainttool.[ch]
	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c
	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: applied patches from Philip
	Lafleur which implement hiding the cursor completely for paint
	tools. Changed the name of the config option from
	"hide-paint-tool-cursor" to "show-paint-tool-cursor" and default
	to TRUE because this needs the brush outline being visible while
	painting to be really usable. Fixes bug #132163.

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h: renamed all GimpCursorType and
	GimpToolCursorType enum values to GIMP_CURSOR_* and
	GIMP_TOOL_CURSOR_*.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-cursor.c
	* app/tools/gimp*tool.c; changed accordingly.

2004-06-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: changed create_cursor_foo() utility
	functions to get_cursor_foo() and use them as accessors instead of
	using cursor->member. Use gdk_pixbuf_copy() instead of compositing
	the initial image onto an empty pixbuf.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.c (gimp_text_editor_new): set the
	focus on the text area.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_class_init): allow to
	move a text layer using the cursor keys.

2004-06-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/*.xbm: removed...

	* cursors/xbm/*.xbm: ...and added here instead. Renamed them
	all to match the PNG file names.

	* cursors/Makefile.am: changed accordingly.

	* app/widget/gimpcursor.c: ditto. Merged the two cursor creating
	functions again because they duplicated too much code.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c (plug_in_menus_setup): populate the
	tree with collation keys and use strcmp() instead of
	g_utf8_collate() as the tree's sort function.

2004-06-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.c (DEFAULT_PRESSURE_PRESSURE):
	applied a patch by Philip Lafleur that changes the default to
	FALSE. Fixes bug #143626.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimpmp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c (gimp_toolbox_size_allocate): use
	gtk_widget_size_request() instead of _get_child_requisition()
	because we need to know the size of the toolbox' areas
	even if they are invisible. Fixes SIGFPE spotted by Jimmac.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.c: some cleanup. Make the tool_cursor
	and cursor_modifier components slightly transparent.

	* cursors/cursor-mouse.png: was the wrong image.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* cursors/Makefile.am
	* cursors/*.png: added PNG version of all cursors.

	* cursors/gimp-tool-cursors.xcf: reordered and renamed all layers
	to match the new PNG filenames.

	* app/widgets/gimpcursor.[ch]: create cursors with alpha and color
	if the GdkDisplay supports it. Fall back to the old stuff
	otherwise.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppattern.c (gimp_pattern_load_pixbuf): if a Title is
	set, use that as the pattern name.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c (gimp_data_factory_load_data):
	removed commented-out message.

	* app/core/gimppattern.[ch]: fixed handling of errors and PNG
	comments in new pattern loader. Renamed functions for consistency
	with other data loaders.

	* app/core/gimp.c: changed accordingly.

2004-06-03  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp.c:
	* app/core/gimpdatafactory.c:
	* app/core/gimppattern.[ch]: Add support for GdkPixbuf patterns,
	so now all of png, jpex, pnm, xbm, bmp, gif, ico, pcx, ras, tga,
	xpm and tiff can be used for patterns.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c: added alternative actions
	"vectors-selection-from-vectors" and
	"vectors-selection-to-vectors-short" with different labels suited
	for the "Select" menu.

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed "select-from-vectors"
	and "select-to-vectors" (to vectors was crashing anyway).

	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]: removed
	select_from_vectors_cmd_callback(). Fixes code dupliction.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/selection-editor-menu.xml: changed accordingly.

2004-06-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c (control_motion): use the newly
	added GimpGradient API to set the segment's handles instead of
	setting the values directly. Dirties the gradient correctly and
	makes the preview update instantly again. Fixes bug #143605.

2004-06-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c
	(file_open_location_completion): check for NULL pointer before
	passing it to g_utf8_normalize(). Just a workaround for a problem
	in GimpContainerView.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/gradient_edit.pdb: set_blending_function() and
	set_coloring_type() work on segment ranges, renamed them
	accordingly. Spotted by Shlomi Fish.

	* app/pdb/gradient_edit_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpgradientedit_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c: plugged a small memory leak.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.h: removed enum GimpDndType...

	* app/widgets/widgets-enums.h: ...and added it here.

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c: added more g_return_if_fail(). Allow
	all gimp_dnd_foo_dest_add() functions to be called without
	callback (just add the target if callback is NULL).

	(gimp_dnd_open_files): removed the checks for validity of the
	passed filenames/uris...

	(gimp_dnd_set_file_data): ...and added it here so all callbacks
	get an already sanitized list of strings.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST)
	* app/menus/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): removed makefile.msc until
	they have been added.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.c: create the hash table when
	inserting items; removes redundant create/destroy cycles and plugs
	a memory leak.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* INSTALL: updated for gimp-2.1. Suggest to use gimp-print
	version 4.2.7-pre1 in case of problems (see bug #138273).

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.c
	(gimp_display_shell_drop_files): copy the merged layer, not the
	first one. Preserve the type of the layer to make e.g. dropping an
	XCF with a single text layer work.

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS
	* README: updated.

2004-06-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	file/uri drops.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-dnd.[ch]
	(gimp_display_shell_drop_files): open any kind of image and turn
	it into a single layer which is added to the image (suggested by
	Antenne Springborn).

2004-06-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/image.pdb
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/core/gimpimage.[ch]: reverted changes I did to the image
	unit earlier. As in 2.0, it will continue to not accept pixels.
	This makes the PDB API and the XCF format compatible again and
	fixes bug #142961 (and to some extent bug #137704).

	* app/core/Makefile.am
	* app/core/gimpimage-unit.[ch]: removed these files. The
	convenience accessors defined here aren't commonly used any
	longer.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: added a unit parameter to
	gimp_display_new(). Made "unit" and "scale" properties of

	* app/pdb/gradients_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/internal_procs.c
	* libgimp/gimpgradients_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

2004-06-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.h: renamed the values of the
	GimpGradientSegment* enums from GIMP_GRAD_* to
	GIMP_GRADIENT_SEGMENT_* because they are exported now.

	* app/core/gimp-gradients.c
	* app/core/gimpgradient.c

2004-06-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c (gimp_session_info_restore): added
	a horrible hack that sets the paned's position after the first
	"size-allocate" after "map". Makes position remembering work for
	the toolbox and fixes bug #142697.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_dockable_set_tab_style()

	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c (dockable_tab_style_cmd_callback)
	* app/widgets/gimpsessioninfo.c (gimp_session_info_restore):

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerentry.[ch]: export the column enum.

	* app/gui/file-open-location-dialog.c: use a GimpContainerEntry
	on the documents list. Use a custom match function that matches

	to the center as suggested by Chad Daelhousen (bug #142968).

2004-05-31  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mblur.c: applied patch from William Skaggs that

	Fish that adds lots of gradient edit functions to
	gimpgradient.[ch] and makes them available through the PDB.
	Fixes bug #129675 and bug #129678.

	Did some cleanups / enhancments to the patch:

	* app/core/gimpgradient.[ch]: changed the naming scheme of the new
	functions and changed old functions to match the new scheme.
	Introduce a "freeze_count" and public freeze()/thaw() API which
	enables subsequent gradient changes without "dirty" being emitted
	all the time.  Added GimpGradient parameters to all functions
	which modify the gradient.

	* app/widgets/gimpgradienteditor.c: use the new freeze/thaw
	stuff to keep the gradient from updating when not in

	editing code and call the new core functions.

	* libgimp/Makefile.am

	single layer as requested in bug #142618.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimplayer_pdb.c: fixed documentation for gimp_resize_layer.
	Patch provided by Philip Lafleur (bug #142618).

2004-05-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c
	(gimp_template_editor_constructor): add the spinbuttons to the
	size entry in the correct order. Fixes bug #143347.

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c (gimp_dnd_open_files): if the dropped
	stuff is a local filename (no file URI), convert it to an
	URI instead of forwarding it unmodified.

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppreview.c (gimp_preview_button_press_event):
	don't invoke the popup preview if there is no viewable.

2004-05-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.c: same workaround for tooltips on
	combo boxes.

2004-05-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c
	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_ui.c
	* plug-ins/common/warp.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: tooltips can't be set on a GtkComboBox so
	we need to pack it into a GtkEventBox when a tooltip is needed.

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfont.c (gimp_font_get_popup_size)
	(gimp_font_get_new_preview): take both logical and ink rectangle
	into account to avoid clipping away parts of the font preview.
	Fixes bug #142277.

2004-05-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfontview.c: set reorderable to FALSE because
	they should not be reodered even if they don't have a sort_func.

	* app/gui/brush-select.c
	* app/gui/gradient-select.c

	airbrush and clone so the stroke dialog's menu of paint functions
	has the same order as the default toolbox order.

2004-05-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch]: removed enum GimpPaintCoreFlags

2004-05-27  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/common/ccanalyze.c: code clean-up. Improved speed a lot
	(500 percent for 1000 x 1000 RGB image) by replacing O(n^2) algorithm
	with O(n) version.

	* app/paint/gimpink.c: restored old time/speed sensitivity
	behaviour by doing nothing except figuring if we draw a straight
	line in INIT_PAINT. Instead, do all the Blob creating in
	MOTION_PAINT and special case the initial (null) "motion"
	accordingly.

	* app/paint/gimpink-blob.[ch]
	* app/paint/gimpink.[ch]
	* app/paint/gimpinkoptions.[ch]: new files. Ported the ink tool
	to be a direct GimpPaintCore subclass without any GUI.

	* app/paint/gimp-paint.c: register GimpInk with the list of paint
	cores.

	* app/tools/Makefile.am

2004-05-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/paint/gimppaintcore.[ch] (gimp_paint_core_paste)
	(gimp_paint_core_replace): replaced the "MaskBuf *paint_mask"
	parameters by "PixelRegion *mask_bufPR", so subclasses can pass in
	any kind of paint_mask buffer and are not restricted to MaskBufs.

	Also removes implicit knowledge about the MaskBuf originating from
	a brush in paint_mask_to_canvas_buf() and _to_canvas_tiles() which
	don't need to offset the mask by width/2 height/2 any more.

	Made gimp_paint_core_validate_undo_tiles() and

	* app/paint/gimpbrushcore.c (gimp_brush_core_paste_canvas)

	and "gboolean use_scale" to GimpBrushCoreClass (defaults to TRUE).

	Removed "scale" parameter from gimp_brush_core_paste_canvas()
	and _replace_canvas().

	* app/paint/gimpsmudge.c (gimp_smudge_class_init): set use_scale
	to FALSE.

2004-05-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimppainttool.c (gimp_paint_tool_button_press): check
	if the GimpPaintCore really is a GimpBrushCore before casting and
	fiddling with internaly.

	* app/paint/gimp-paint.c
	* app/paint/gimppaintcore-stroke.c

2004-05-24  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: derive GimpToolInfo from

	Long overdue core container cleanup:

	* app/core/gimplist.[ch]: added "unique-names" and "sort-func"
	properties and merged the resp. code from GimpDataList into
	GimpList. Removed "policy" parameters from gimp_list_new() and

	Made public function gimp_list_uniquefy_name() private.

	* app/core/Makefile.am

	* app/actions/file-commands.c
	* app/actions/templates-commands.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.c: removed calls to
	gimp_list_uniquefy_name().

	themselves where ensuring their unique names. Bah!

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_name_changed): chain up
	conditionally.

	* app/core/gimplayermask.c (gimp_layer_mask_name_changed): removed
	because there is no need any more to keep the parent
	implementation from being invoked.

2004-05-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-05-23  Michael Schumacher <schumaml@cvs.gnome.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.def: gimp_register_file_handler_mime added

2004-05-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: reoedered to somehow reflect the
	class hierarchy.

	Some dockable context handling cleanup:

	* app/widgets/gimpdocked.[ch]: removed "prev_context" parameter
	from GimpDocked::set_context(). Widgets which need the old context
	to disconnect from should remember it themselves.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c (gimp_dockable_set_context): don't
	pass the old context to gimp_docked_set_context().
	Some cleanup.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/display/gimpnavigationview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpimageeditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.[ch]: added a "context" member
	which holds the context set by GimpDocked::set_context().

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawabletreeview.c: use the view's context
	instead of gimp_get_user_context().

	* app/widgets/gimpcoloreditor.[ch]: removed separate API to
	set the context because it implements the GimpDockedInterface.

	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c: pass "menu-factory",
	"menu-identifier" and "ui-path" to g_object_new() instead of
	calling gimp_editor_create_menu() later.

	Action cleanup partly related to the context stuff above:

	* app/actions/actions.c (action_data_get_gimp): get the Gimp from
	context->gimp, not gimage->gimp because gimage may be NULL.

	(action_data_get_context): changed to use the new context members
	added above.

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c (channels_actions_update): cleanup.

	* app/actions/edit-actions.c (edit_actions_update): fixed
	sensitivity of "edit-undo-clear".

	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (vectors_actions_update): make
	"vectors-merge-visible" sensitive only if there is more than one
	GimpVectors in the image.

	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/palette-editor-actions.c: added FG/BG color previews
	to actions which take colors from them. Changed code to be safe

	* app/actions/drawable-commands.c:
	s/active_drawable/drawable/g. Makes the code more readable.

	functions and other stuff which is not needed any more because
	dialog buttons invoke the correct actions now. Moved the
	functions' code to the resp. action callbacks.

2004-05-17  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	of asking the UI manager.

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: changed gimp_ui_manager_ui_get()

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-params.c (plug_in_proc_args_check): changed
	warnings to include the invalid menu path. Added check that makes
	sure menu paths are either "<Prefix>" or "<Prefix>/foo" but *not*
	"<Prefix>foo".

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: added function
	plug_in_actions_check_translation() which validates both the
	original and translated menu paths and spits detailed error
	messages if any of them is broken. Made action creation simpler
	(?) and more robust.

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c: argh, the translated menu path must
	be a sorting criteria *only*. Fixed the whole stuff to always use
	the original menu path because translation is done entirely by
	plug-in-actions.c. Fixes bad crashes for all locales. Added
	boolean return value to plug_in_menus_build_path() and don't try
	to create the menu item in an invalid location if creating the
	submenus failed.

2004-05-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/menus/file-dialog-menu.c: check if the file procedure

	action name (mostly taken from shared-mime-info) and register to
	the <Load> and <Save> menus using gimp_plugin_menu_register().

	and <Save> menus using gimp_plugin_menu_register().

2004-05-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/lib.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdbgen.pl: added new procedure variable 'since'
	that allows to specify when a new function was added. Use that
	info to generate an appropriate gtk-doc comment.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: set since = '2.2' for the new
	function gimp_plugin_menu_register().

	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.c: regenerated.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* menus/tool-options-menu.xml: added "name" attributes to all
	submenus.

	* app/menus/tool-options-menu.c: use the menu names instead of the
	overly long action names.

	* app/actions/colormap-editor-commands.c
	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.c: added some callback
	implementations.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c

	* app/actions/actions.c
	* app/actions/colormap-editor-actions.c

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpcontainer.c (gimp_container_add_handler): don't
	try to lookup detailed "notify::foo" signal specs.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	column which toggles tool visibility.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c (tools_actions_update): don't use
	action_data_get_context() to update the "tools" action group
	because it may return NULL. Use gimp_get_user_context() instead
	because the active tool is global regardless of the action group's
	context. Fixes accidential tool hiding when closing the last
	display.

2004-05-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.c (gimp_thumbnail_save_thumb): oops.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Added GimpViewable infrastructure which enables migrating from
	TempBuf to GdkPixbuf for both providing and getting previews:

	* app/core/gimpviewable.[ch]: added new virtual functions
	GimpViewable::get_pixbuf() and GimpViewable::get_new_pixbuf()
	which are implemented exactly as get_preview() and
	get_new_preview() except that get_new_pixbuf() has a default
	implementation which creates the pixbuf from a TempBuf.

	Renamed public functions _get_preview_pixbuf() and
	_get_new_preview_pixbuf() to _get_pixbuf() and _get_new_pixbuf().

	Added gimp_viewable_get_dummy_pixbuf() and use it from
	gimp_viewable_get_dummy_preview().

	* app/core/gimpimagefile.c (gimp_imagefile_save_thumb)
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_update_icon)
	* app/gui/resize-dialog.c (resize_dialog_new): changed accordingly.

2004-05-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpthumb/gimpthumbnail.[ch]: added mime-type support.

2004-05-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	file-dialog-menu.[ch]

	* app/menus/menus.[ch]: removed menus_open_recent_add()...

	* app/menus/file-menu.[ch]: ...and added it here as file_menu_setup().

	* app/menus/image-menu.c
	* app/menus/toolbox-menu.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/menus/file-dialog-menu.[ch]: added factored out code from the
	file-open and file-save menus as file_dialog_menu_setup().

	* app/menus/file-open-menu.c
	* app/menus/file-save-menu.c: call file_dialog_menu_setup().

2004-05-12  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/select-actions.c
	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.[ch]: added tooltips for actions
	which are now used for dialog buttons, added callback
	implementations which formerly lived in various widgets, moved
	some actions around and did some general cleanups.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: s/edit-stroke/select-stroke/

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/selection-editor-menu.xml: new popup menu.

	* app/menus/menus.c: register <SelectionEditor> and <UndoEditor>
	UI managers.

	* app/widgets/gimpeditor.[ch]: added construct properties
	"menu-factory", "menu-identifier", "ui-path" and "popup-data".
	Implement GObject::constructor() and create the UI manager
	if all needed properties were set. Enables creating action
	buttons at widget construction time because they need a
	UI manager.

	(gimp_editor_add_action_button): extended to take a va_list of
	"extended" actions which are invoked if the resp. button emits
	"extended_clicked". Store the actions and their modifier masks in
	a list attached to the button.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainerview.c
	(gimp_container_view_item_selected): if the view has container
	*and* context, simply change the context and return.

	(gimp_container_view_context_changed): don't emit "select_item"
	manually but simply call gimp_container_view_select_item().

	(gimp_container_view_viewable_dropped): use
	gimp_container_view_item_selected() instead of changing the
	context directly.

	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.c
	(gimp_container_editor_select_item): update the UI manager.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c: don't try to fiddle with the
	dialog's menu if it doesn't have a ui_path (happens if the UI
	manager is just a collection of actions for the dialog buttons and
	has no menu registered).

	* app/widgets/gimpimageeditor.c: connect to the image's "flush"
	signal and update the UI manager in the callback.

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: use GimpEditor's construct
	properties to create the UI manager so GimpItemTreeView subclasses
	can have action buttons. Update the UI manager in
	gimp_item_tree_view_select_item().

	* app/widgets/gimpbufferview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c

	unneeded select_item() implementations.

	* app/widgets/gimpvectorstreeview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimplayertreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimpselectioneditor.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.[ch]: use action buttons and removed
	lots of callbacks which went to the resp. action callbacks.

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: removed some now unneeded function
	prototypes.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: changed (simplified) many dialog
	constructors accordingly.

2004-05-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c (gimp_scale_entry_new_internal)

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c: do not explicitely resize
	the statusbar cursor label, connect to GimpDisplayShell::scaled
	instead. Added a GimpScaleComboBox to the status bar.

2004-05-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Started making the toolbox configurable.
	Addresses bug #105764. Not finished yet.

	* app/core/gimptoolinfo.[ch]: renamed "in_toolbox" to "visible"
	and made it a GObject property.

	* app/tools/gimp-tools.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_tools_get_default_order() which returns a GList of tool
	identifiers.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c
	* app/actions/tools-commands.[ch]: added actions & callbacks for
	toggling the "visible" boolean and for resetting all tools.

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimptoolview.[ch]: new widget which allows to
	toggle a tool's visibility and to reorder the tools.

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.[ch]: removed member "GtkWidget *trash"
	and pack all tool buttons into the same wrap box. Connect to
	"reoder" of the tool container and to "notify::visible" of all
	tool infos and update the toolbox accordingly.

	* app/gui/dialogs-constructors.c: create a GimpToolView for the
	tools list/grid.

	* app/menus/menus.c: register a <Tools> menu for the dialog above.

	* menus/Makefile.am

2004-05-10  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.c: re-added help for menu items. Still
	incomplete because there is no fallback help ID yet when pressing
	F1 over a menu item which has a submenu. Added evil workaround and
	version check for signal brokenness of GtkUIManager in GTK+ 2.4.1.

2004-05-09  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	Merge from stable branch :

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c : support gray images;
	fixes bug #141382

	* plug-ins/common/winprint.c : dito; fixes bug #141145

2004-05-09  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/common/aa.c
	* plug-ins/common/apply_lens.c
	* plug-ins/common/autocrop.c

2004-05-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: renamed struct member combo to

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpunitcombobox.[ch]

	* app/display/gimpstatusbar.[ch]: use the new GimpUnitComboBox and
	GimpUnitStore.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: hardcode the appearance of the
	GimpUnitComboBox. It uses a hack that doesn't work in list mode.

2004-05-07  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-colormap.[ch]: added a const qualifier.

	Changed how the image unit and dot-for-dot mode is handled. Might
	break things and certainly needs more changes (mainly in tools):

	* app/core/gimptemplate.c: allow GIMP_UNIT_PIXEL as image unit.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-scale.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-title.c

	rulers and to display lengths.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: redone GimpTemplateEditor
	based on a dialog mockup from Jimmac and Tigert.

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: changed some descriptions used by the

	formatting cleanups in some query() functions.

2004-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]: removed member "accelerator".
	It was never set and this is the conceptually wrong place to store
	it anyway.

	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: changed accordingly.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugins_query): always return NULL
	as accelerator. Cleaned up the function a bit and made it aware of
	proc_def->menu_label added below.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-05-07  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Changed plug-in menu registration again to allow passing just the
	menu item's label (not the full path) in gimp_install_procedure()
	and only the path (excluding the item's label) in
	gimp_plugin_menu_register(). Matches the internal action system
	better and makes translating the menu paths much easier.

	(Of yourse it's still possible to use the old syntax for backward
	compatibility).

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]: added "gchar *menu_label".

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-params.[ch]: added new functions
	plug_in_param_defs_check() and plug_in_proc_args_check() which
	check if a procedure's parameters match its menu location
	(e.g. <Image> needs RUN-MODE, IMAGE, DRAWABLE).

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_install): if
	registering an old-style (full) menu_path, use
	plug_in_param_defs_check(), set proc_def->menu_label otherwise.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb (plugin_menu_register): use
	plug_in_proc_args_check() on the passed menu_path and make sure
	old and new style menu registration are not mixed.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c: regenerated.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-rc.c: save/restore "menu_label".

	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c
	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.c: changed action/menu creation
	accordingly. Some hacks needed to allow both old and new style
	menu_label/menu_paths.

	* app/plug-in/plug-in.c
	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c
	* app/xcf/xcf.c: changed accordingly.

	before any app headers.

        * tools/pdbgen/pdb/paint_tools.pdb: Fix silly "Dodgebure" typo.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-preview.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-projection.c: added sanity so we don't just
	plain crash when an indexed image doesn't have a colormap.

	* plug-ins/common/png.c: keep at least one entry in the colormap.
	Fixes bug #142029.

2004-05-06  Maurits Rijk  <m.rijk@chello.nl>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c: replaced RMS macro by smarter one,
	resulting in a doubling in speed for this plug-in.

	* plug-ins/fp/Makefile.am: changed accordingly

	* plug-ins/fp/fp.c: merged into one single file to get rid of all
	global variables and functions. Major clean-up. Still more to come.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/about-dialog.c: center the about dialog on the monitor,
	not on the screen. Fixes window position on xinerama setups.

2004-05-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/plug_in.pdb: renamed gimp_plugin_menu_add() to
	gimp_plugin_menu_register() for consistency with other
	gimp_plugin_foo_register() functions which can be called during
	query().

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* plug-ins/common/ccanalyze.c
	* plug-ins/common/colortoalpha.c
	* plug-ins/common/screenshot.c
	* plug-ins/winsnap/winsnap.c: changed accordingly.

2004-05-06  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Enabled multiple menu entries per plug-in procedure:

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.[ch]: changed "gchar *menu_path" to

	* app/menus/plug-in-menus.[ch]: create proxy widgets for each
	element of proc_def->menu_paths.

	* app/pdb/plug_in_cmds.c
	* libgimp/gimpplugin_pdb.[ch]: regenerated.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: added lots of <placeholder>s for
	logical groups (like Image/Resize, Image/Scale, Image/Crop
	etc.). Added empty placeholder File/Send for stuff like print and
	mail. Added an "Acquire" menu under <Image>/File

	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/common/winprint.c: register under File/Send.

	* plug-ins/common/zealouscrop.c: register additional menu entries
	under placeholders in the "Image" and "Layer" menus. This is not
	meant to be final but just a hint to keep in mind when
	reorganizing the plug-in menus.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/resize-dialog.[ch]: cleaned up variable names and
	external API. Still quite a mess.

	* app/Makefile.am

	* app/actions/layers-commands.c: changed accordingly.

2004-05-06  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/file-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-commands.[ch]: remove "file-close" action and
	callback...

	* app/actions/view-actions.c

	"View" menu after the zoom group.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed action "select-by-color".

	* app/tools/gimpbycolorselecttool.c: add the shortcut here.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: added alternative tool actions for

	they have the same accelerators as the generated ones.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: use the alternative actions for
	"<Image>/Select/By Color" and
	"<Layer>/Transform/Arbitrary Rotation...".

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimphelpui.c: documentation.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Finally enable global accelerators in all docks:

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c (gimp_image_dock_constructor):
	iterate all of the UI manager's actions and enable their
	accelerators manually. Fixes bug #119878.

2004-05-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpviewabledialog.c: added construct properties to
	make it possible to derive from GimpViewableDialog.

	* app/widgets/gimptooldialog.[ch]: make GimpToolDialog a real
	object, not just a convenience constructor.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: set a smaller border_width of 6 pixels for
	the action area of tool dialogs.

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c
	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c: set a smaller border_width of 6
	pixels on tool dialogs to make them more compact.

2004-05-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpoffsetarea.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_offset_area_set_pixbuf(). Started to clean up the
	code a bit.

	* app/gui/resize-dialog.c (resize_widget_new): use the new feature

2004-05-05  Jakub Steiner <jimmac@ximian.com>

	* data/images/gimp_splash.png: ustable splash

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/menus.c: register a <Dock> UI manager which has all
	action groups <Image> has except "view".

	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.[ch]: re-enabled the global shortcuts,
	using UI manager instead of item factory. Unfortunately actions
	without proxy widgets can't be activated so this change is pretty
	useless. Oh well, will find a hack to work around this later...

	boldening of the frame title.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	convenient to use with activatable widgets such as toggle buttons.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c: removed debugging output, added

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Fix bug #141719:

	* app/tools/gimpmovetool.c (gimp_move_tool_motion): use RINT()
	instead of ROUND() to round double coords to guide positions.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	(gimp_display_shell_canvas_tool_events): pass RINT()-rounded
	coords to gimp_display_shell_update_cursor() instead of implicitly
	truncating by casting to int.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.c: removed code duplication by adding
	utility function gimp_undo_editor_update_buttons(), some general
	cleanups.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_undo_freeze,thaw): emit the
	"undo-freeze" and "undo-thaw" signals only on the first freeze and
	last thaw, not on any of them.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp-ids.h: added GIMP_HELP_EDIT_UNDO_CLEAR.

	* app/widgets/gimpundoeditor.[ch]: added a "Clear Undo History"
	button. Fixes bug #136300.

	Also don't attach to the image's undo stack if the image's undo is
	disabled and set the buttons' sensitivity accordingly. Should fix
	all kinds of unpredictable undo history brokenness.

2004-05-04  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Treat FG/BG just like all other context properties:

	* app/paint/gimppaintoptions.h: added GIMP_CONTEXT_FOREGROUND_MASK
	and _BACKGROUND_MASK to GIMP_PAINT_OPTIONS_CONTEXT_MASK to specify
	that they are used by GimpPaintOptions (automatically affects all
	paint tools).

	* app/tools/gimpblendtool.c
	* app/tools/gimpbucketfilltool.c
	* app/tools/gimpinktool.c: set FOREGROUND_MASK and BACKGROUND_MASK
	manually here.

	* app/tools/tool_manager.c (tool_manager_tool_changed): decide
	about the globality of FG and BG at the same place where we decide
	about the brush's, pattern's etc. globality, but hardcode them to
	global = TRUE instead of looking at GimpConfig.

	Fixes bug #141786.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/sobel.c (sobel_dialog): removed frame, adjusted
	spacing, fixes bug #141773.

2004-05-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c:
	* app/widgets/gimpstrokeeditor.c: moved line style options into a
	GtkExpander. Changed dialog spacings.

2004-05-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c: initialize is_active for qmask-toggle.

	* app/actions/tools-actions.c: set entry help_id from tool_info,
	since gimp_action_group_add_string_actions expects it to be there
	now.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_new): added a hack that
	allows to get the label_spacing but no label. Useful when the frame
	is packed into a GtkExpander.

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: pack the "Image Comment" frame
	into a GtkExpander to reduce clutter and dialog size.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimphelpui.[ch]: added gimp_help_id_quark()
	which is G_GNUC_CONST and a new macro GIMP_HELP_ID as shortcut.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c (gimp_action_group_add_*_actions):
	attach the help ID to the action using the new quark key. Call
	gtk_action_group_add_action() instead of the _with_accel() variant
	if the accel is the empty string (== if we explicitely want no
	accel even if the stock item specifies one). Fixes warning flood
	with GTK+ 2.4.1.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c: if the label_widget is a button, set
	the button label as bold. Cache the indentation instead of
	calculating it over and over again.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc: set HIG-compliant spacing for the
	action_area.

	* app/widgets/gimppropwidgets.[ch]: added
	gimp_prop_enum_radio_box_new() for a radio group that is no
	embedded in a frame.

	* app/widgets/gimpstrokeeditor.c: use a frame-less radio box for
	the Stroke style.

	* app/gui/file-new-dialog.c
	* app/gui/grid-dialog.c
	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c: HIG-compliant spacings.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdock.c (gimp_dock_key_press_event): new function
	which overrides GtkWindow's default handler in order to give the
	focus widget precedence over accelerators for keys without any
	modifier or with <Shift> modifier. Enables e.g. having a <Shift>+s
	accelerator while still being able to enter 'S' in an entry.
	Thanks to Tim Janik for the code.

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Gimp, GimpImage, GimpDisplay and GtkWidget from the "data" pointer
	passed to action callbacks.

	* app/actions/select-commands.c
	* app/actions/tools-commands.c
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c
	* app/actions/vectors-commands.c
	* app/actions/view-commands.c: use the new functions instead of
	duplicating insane macros and if() constructs over and over again.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.c: use a GimpFrame for
	gimp_radio_group_new() and friends.

	* themes/Default/gtkrc
	* themes/Small/gtkrc: set a smaller label_spacing for GimpFrame
	widgets in GimpDockables. Lame hack to keep the tool options
	compact.

	* app/actions/image-commands.c: changed spacing.

	* app/gui/offset-dialog.c: merged check and radio buttons into a
	single radio button group; changed spacing.

2004-05-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_size_allocate): respect
	the frame's border width.

	* app/gui/convert-dialog.c
	* app/gui/info-window.c
	* app/gui/palette-import-dialog.c

2004-05-03  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/dockable-commands.c (dockable_add_tab_cmd_callback):
	truncate the passed dialog identifier at the first '|'. Fixes
	creating brushes, paterns etc. dialogs from the dockables'
	"Add Tab" menu.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.c (gimp_frame_size_request): take the
	left margin into account.

	* app/widgets/gimpgrideditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: removed container borders that
	aren't needed any longer.

	* app/widgets/gimpenumwidgets.c
	* app/widgets/gimpgrideditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c: use the GimpFrame widget,
	changed some spacings to better comply with the HIG.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpwidgets/Makefile.am
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgets.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpwidgetstypes.h
	* libgimpwidgets/gimpframe.[ch]: added new widget GimpFrame, a HIG
	compliant variant of GtkFrame.

	* app/gui/preferences-dialog.c: enable the HIG compliant mode by
	default and use the new GimpFrame widget for it.

	* themes/Small/gtkrc: set a smaller spacing between the GimpFrame
	title label and the frame content.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/qmask-actions.c: renamed action "qmask-toggle" to
	"qmask-active" and added new action "qmask-toggle" with a label
	and shortcut suited for the "Select" menu.

	* app/actions/select-actions.c: removed "select-toggle-qmask".

	* app/actions/select-commands.[ch]: removed callback
	select_toggle_quickmask_cmd_callback().

	* app/actions/channels-actions.c (channels_actions_update)
	* app/actions/vectors-actions.c (vectors_actions_update): handle
	"data" being both GimpDisplay and GimpDisplayShell so the actions
	can be used in the image menu.

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: s/select-toggle-qmask/qmask-toggle/.

	* menus/qmask-menu.xml: s/qmask-toggle/qmask-active/.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in
	* menus/tool-options-menu.xml
	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml.in: use empty elements for empty menus.
	Makes the XML somewhat easier to read.

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/dialogs-menuitems.xml: new file that holds menuitems that
	appear in several places.

	* menus/menus.xsl: allow inclusion of menuitems using XInclude.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/file-dialog-actions.[ch]: new files containing
	factored out code to set up the <Load> and <Save> actions.
	Use GimpPlugInActions instead of just GtkActions.

	* app/actions/file-dialog-commands.[ch]: new files containing
	file_dialog_type_cmd_callback() which is a
	GimpPlugInAction::selected() callback now.

	* app/actions/file-commands.[ch]: removed the callback here.

	* app/actions/file-open-actions.c
	* app/actions/file-save-actions.c: removed code duplication and
	use file_dialog_actions_setup() instead.

2004-05-02  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/*-actions.c: added help IDs to all actions
	representing the toplevel popups and menus (as fallbacks for the
	still-to-be-written help system intrgration of GimpUIManager).

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c (gimp_display_shell_new): removed
	call to gtk_ui_manager_ensure_update() because that's done by
	gimp_ui_manager_ui_get() now.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.[ch]: removed API to register and
	create item factories.

	* app/gui/menus.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c
	* app/widgets/gimpdockbook.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpimagedock.c
	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c: removed leftover item factory
	cruft.

	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h: removed item factory typedefs...

	* app/widgets/gimpitemfactory.h: ...and added them here.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added new function
	gimp_action_group_add_plug_in_actions().

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use it here instead of adding
	the actions manually.

	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c: ported the code which dynamically
	updates the tool button tooltips on accelerator changes to
	GtkAction. Disabled the whole stuff because GTK+ lacks
	gtk_action_get_accel_closure().

2004-05-02  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* menus/Makefile.am: added a rule to generate gtkuimanager XML
	files using an XSL transformation.

	* menus/menus.xsl: a simple XSLT to generate a menubar and a popup
	menu with identical content.

	* menus/image-menu.xml: removed this file from CVS ...

	* menus/image-menu.xml.in: ... and added this instead.

	* HACKING: xsltproc is now needed to build from CVS.

2004-05-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: check for xmllint and xsltproc but don't require
	these tools.

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* tips/Makefile.am: simplified "validate" targets.

2004-04-30  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c: Cleanups.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_coords_to_integer): Undo my bogus fix for
	bug #138103, which led to bug #140649.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c (procedural_db_init_procs): Add missing
	compat procs: gimp_channel_ops_duplicate, gimp_channel_ops_offset.

2004-04-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.c: added casts to please the compiler.

2004-04-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added signal "update" which
	is G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST, so handlers can hook in before and after
	the default implementation. Update the action groups
	in the default implementations.

	(gimp_ui_manager_ui_get): make sure we always return a widget
	by calling gtk_ui_manager_ensure_update().

	* app/widgets/gimpdockable.c (gimp_dockable_show_menu): make
	sure the dockable menu is loaded before trying to access its
	widgets/actions.

	Resurrected the dynamic tool options menus:

	* app/actions/tool-options-actions.c: dynamically destroy/create
	actions for the tool options' presets.

	* app/actions/tool-options-commands.[ch]: all callbacks are
	GimpEnumAction::selected() callbacks now.

	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.[ch]: connect and connect_after to
	GimpUIManager::update(). Remove the old preset menu items
	in the former callback, create the new ones in the latter.
	Removed the last item factory entries.

	* app/gui/menus.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: changed accordingly.

2004-04-29  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/main.c: when glibc is used, call mallopt, so that memory
	chunks >= 4k (= 64*64 pixels, 1bpp - the smallest full tile)
	get allocated via mmap. This ensures that after closing an image
	the memory allocated for image data gets returned to the system.

	Thanks to Phil Blundell <pb@nexus.co.uk> for bringing mallopt
	to my attention.

	Please watch closely for performance problems.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/actions/Makefile.am
	* app/actions/file-open-actions.[ch]
	* app/actions/file-save-actions.[ch]: actions for the <Load> and
	<Save> menus...

	* menus/Makefile.am
	* menus/file-open-menu.xml
	* menus/file-save-menu.xml: ...and the menus.

	* app/gui/file-open-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/file-save-menu.[ch]: ported to UI Manager.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: ditto.

	* app/actions/actions.c
	* app/gui/menus.c
	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.c: removed debugging code which
	automatically loaded all registered menus. They are now loaded on
	demand only.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* libgimpbase/gimputils.[ch] (gimp_escape_uline): new function
	which does the opposite of gimp_strip_uline().

	* app/actions/file-actions.c (file_actions_last_opened_update):
	escape ulines in filenames so they don't end up as mnemonics.
	Spotted by Pedro Gimeno.

2004-04-29  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: Quick fix to make uppercase
	tags work properly.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimp*tool.c (gimp_*_tool_register): stripped the menu
	paths from the "menu_path". Will be renamed to "action_name" or
	something soon...

	* plug-ins/dbbrowser/dbbrowser.c
	* plug-ins/common/plugindetails.c
	* plug-ins/common/uniteditor.c: register under the new
	"Extensions" placeholder.

2004-04-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Switch from GtkItemFactory to GtkUIManager. The migration is
	almost complete, still stuff missing/incomplete, definitely added
	a bunch of new bugs...

	* app/actions/*-commands.[ch]: converted all callback from
	GtkItemFactory callbacks to GtkAction callbacks.

	* app/actions/debug-actions.c
	* app/actions/gradient-editor-actions.c
	* app/actions/help-actions.c
	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c

	* app/display/gimpdisplay.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-appearance.[ch]
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: move everything from
	GtkItemFactory to GtkUIManager.

	* app/gui/dialogs.[ch]: added new function dialogs_get_toolbox().
	Needed because the action callbacks don't have a widget parameter
	and sometimes we need a parent window for showing dialogs.

	* app/gui/Makefile.am
	* app/gui/brushes-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/buffers-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/channels-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/colormap-editor-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/dialogs-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/documents-menu.[ch]

	menu and the toolbox menubar.

	* app/gui/menus.[ch]: removed all GtkItemFactory code.

	* app/gui/image-menu.[ch]
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.[ch]: removed everything except the trivial
	setup_funcs.

	* app/gui/file-open-menu.c
	* app/gui/file-save-menu.c
	* app/gui/tool-options-menu.c: don't use the macros from menus.h
	any more, they are gone.

	* app/gui/gui-vtable.c
	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: create/destroy the dynamic plug-in
	menu entries.

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c: s/gimp_item_factory_update/
	gimp_ui_manager_update/g

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added API to get an action
	group by name.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c: don't choke on the item_factory
	entries being NULL.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.c: make sure booleans set using
	g_object_set() only have TRUE or FALSE values.

	* app/widgets/gimpcolormapeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcomponenteditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainereditor.[ch]

	* app/widgets/gimpitemtreeview.c
	* app/widgets/gimppaletteeditor.c
	* app/widgets/gimptoolbox.c
	* app/widgets/gimptooloptionseditor.c: removed all GtkItemFactory
	code and enable the #if 0'ed UI manager stuff.

	* menus/gradient-editor-menu.xml: fixed typos.

	* menus/image-menu.xml: duplicate everything so we have both
	an image menubar and an image popup menu. Badly cries for an
	XSL processor.

	* menus/toolbox-menu.xml: added an "Extensions" placeholder.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimppluginaction.[ch]: new GtkAction subclass which
	remembers the PlugInProcDef.

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: added "gpointer user_data" to
	the GimpActionGroup struct and to gimp_action_group_new(). Removed
	the user_data parameter from gimp_action_group_add_*_actions().

	* app/widgets/gimpactionfactory.[ch]: changed accordingly.

	* app/actions/*-actions.[ch]: removed user_data from all setup_funcs.

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: use a GimpPlugInAction and
	finally use the right user_data for the callback so plug-in
	callbacks have a proper context.

	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: renamed plug_in_menus_create2() to
	plug_in_menus_setup().

	* app/gui/image-menu.c
	* app/gui/toolbox-menu.c: changed accordingly.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]: removed "translation-domain"
	property and simply use gettext(). Plug-In domains are handled
	by plug-in-actions.c

	The following change finally starts breaking the old menu system
	while the new one is not fully in place yet. Have fun:

	* menus/image-menu.xml: added several <placeholder>s for plug-ins
	to register their menu entries in the middle of already existing
	menus.

	* app/gui/menus.c
	* plug-ins/common/mail.c
	* plug-ins/print/print.c
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: use the new
	placeholders to register menu entries.

2004-04-27  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Correctly translated & sorted plug-in actions & menu entries:

	* app/widgets/gimpuimanager.[ch]: added a "gchar *name" property
	and a hash table which keeps all created UI managers (similar to
	GimpActionGroup's hash table). Added function
	gimp_ui_managers_from_name() which returns a list of all managers
	with the given name.

	* app/widgets/gimpmenufactory.c: register a name per UI manager
	and pass the name to gimp_ui_manager_new().

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.c: added code which correctly
	translates the created plug-in actions and also creates translated
	menu actions for the plug-in's menu_path elements.

	* app/gui/plug-in-menus.[ch]: sort the plug-ins' menu entries
	using a GTree. For each entry, recursivlely create submenus
	from the dynamic menu actions created above before creating
	the plug-in's menu entry itself.

	* app/gui/image-menu.c (image_menu_setup2)

	* app/actions/plug-in-actions.[ch] (plug_in_actions_setup):
	removed the tree sorting code. Actions don't need to be ordered
	alphabetically.

	don't forget to free the list of managed UIs.

	calls because they were invoking toggle and radio callbacks
	which still have the wrong signature.

	* plug-ins/gflare/gflare.c: ported the last plug-in from

	* libgimpwidgets/gimpintcombobox.c (gimp_int_combo_box_new):

	* app/gui/dialogs-commands.[ch]
	* app/gui/dialogs-menu.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/gui/edit-commands.[ch]: added edit_paste_into_cmd_callback()
	and remove usage of "guint action".

	* app/gui/image-menu.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/gui/palette-editor-commands.[ch]: split
	+palette_editor_new_color_cmd_callback() into separate callbacks
	for adding from FG and BG.

2004-04-19  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/gimp-headers.scm
	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/gimp-labels.scm: applied a patch from
	William Skaggs which changes the sub menu title for the gimp web
	theme to classic.gimp.org. Fixes bug #137036.

2004-04-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdrawabletreeview.c: removed unused includes.

2004-04-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

2004-04-19  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpenumstore.[ch]: avoid unnecessary casts.

	* app/widgets/gimpenumcombobox.[ch]: added an API that inserts a
	GtkTreeModelFilter to make items invisible. This is a kludge to
	workaround bug #135875.

	* app/tools/gimpcurvestool.c
	* app/tools/gimplevelstool.c
	* app/widgets/gimphistogrameditor.c: use the new function to hide

	* app/widgets/gimptemplateeditor.c
	(gimp_template_editor_constructor): use g_signal_connect_object()
	instead of g_signal_connect(). Fixes bug #140315.

2004-04-18  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* plug-ins/common/gauss_iir.c: Change tabs to spaces all over the
	file, in preparation for other changes. Minor cleanup.

	* plug-ins/common/gauss_rle.c (gauss_rle): Plug a leak with the
	returned value from make_curve().

	* plug-ins/common/tga.c (load_image): Fix a condition which was

	mnemonic. Fixes bug #139868.

2004-04-17  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (save_dialog): live preview doesn't
	modify the undo history of the image anymore, label changed
	accordingly. Fixes bug #140296.

2004-04-16  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* plug-ins/common/tile.c (tile): changed a call to
	gimp_image_undo_enable to _undo_disable which was obviously the
	intention of the author. Added a call to gimp_drawable_update to
	get the previews refreshed.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcolorpickertool.c
	* app/tools/gimpmeasuretool.c: don't use gtk_window_present() to
	raise the tool dialog since it also moves the focus away from the
	image window. Fixes the problem described in bug #139349.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpcroptool.c: some code cleanup that I forgot to do
	when applying the patch.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/Makefile.am
	* app/widgets/widgets-types.h
	* app/widgets/gimpactiongroup.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpenumaction.[ch]
	* app/widgets/gimpstringaction.[ch]: added some completely unused
	GtkAction infrastructure.

2004-04-15  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/Makefile.am
	* app/Makefile.am
	* configure.in: app, tools, and user dir bumped to version 2.1 names.

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c: since we now depend on pango 1.4, we can
	use pango_fc_font_description_from_pattern() instead of our
	cut-n-paste function, gimp_font_list_font_desc_from_pattern().

2004-04-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_install)
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-proc.h (struct _PlugInProcDef)
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-rc.c (plug_in_rc_write)
	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c (plug_ins_init): Make PDB procedures
	(including their menu entries) installed during a plug-ins init()
	phase show up. Add a flag to PlugInProcDef that tells whether the
	proc was installed during the init() phase. Such procs aren't
	saved to the pluginrc. Move the code that initializes plug-ins
	that need initialization earlier, before the procs are added to
	the PDB and menus are built. Fixes bug #139969.

2004-04-16  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap.c: removed the AlienMap plug-in since
	AlienMap2 duplicates its functionality.

	* plug-ins/common/AlienMap2.c: applied patch from William Skaggs
	with a couple of user interface improvements (bug #140079).

2004-04-15  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* libgimpthumb/Makefile.am: For Win32, install gimpthumb.def, like
	the .def files of the other libgimp* libs.

	* gimp-zip.in: Put also libgimpthumb in the developer package.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/winicon/icodialog.c: fixed gtk+ includes, added a
	warning that deprecated widgets are being used.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in

	* plug-ins/winicon/icoload.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/icosave.[ch]
	* plug-ins/winicon/main.[ch]: added plug-in to load and save
	Windows icon files. Plug-in written by Christian Kreibich, port to
	GIMP-2.0 API by Gregor Riepl, massive code cleanup by me. Fixes
	bug #139160.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpdnd.c (gimp_dnd_data_source_add)
	(gimp_dnd_data_source_remove): use the new dynamic GtkTargetList
	based API for changing the widget's drag source types.

	* app/widgets/gimpdocumentview.c (gimp_document_view_new): simply
	call gimp_dnd_file_source_add() instead of duplicating the whole
	GtkTargetEntry array insanity just for adding one source type.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/FractalExplorer/Dialogs.c
	* plug-ins/flame/flame.c
	* plug-ins/gfig/gfig.c: first plug-ins ported to GtkFileChooser.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.c
	* app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c: removed runtime version
	checks and workarounds for bugs which are fixed in GTK+ 2.4.

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.c
	(gimp_file_dialog_selection_changed): added runtime check for GTK+
	2.4.1 and work around GtkFileChooser's missing "update_preview"
	functionality for multiple selections if the dependency is not
	met.

	* app/widgets/gimpwidgets-utils.c (gimp_menu_position)
	(gimp_menu_button_position): call gtk_menu_set_monitor() until
	bug #139187 is fixed.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/widgets/gimpfiledialog.[ch]: derive it from GtkFileChooser
	instead of GtkFileSelection.

	* app/gui/file-dialog-utils.c
	* app/gui/file-open-dialog.c
	* app/gui/file-save-dialog.c
	* app/widgets/gimpthumbbox.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/tools/gimpimagemaptool.c
	* app/widgets/gimperrorconsole.c
	* app/widgets/gimptexteditor.c

	file selectors.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	allows to keep the aspect ratio fixed.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimplayermask.c (gimp_layer_mask_class_init): set
	translate_desc to "Move Layer Mask".

	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c: take the undo desc
	from the moved item's class instead of duplicating all
	strings here.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimppalette-import.[ch]
	* app/gui/palette-import-dialog.c: added palette import from RIFF
	palette files based on a patch from ÃRDI GergÃµ (bug #129788).

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/xcf/xcf.c (xcf_save_invoker) (xcf_load_invoker): forgot
	to add context parameters to this non-generated PDB invokers.
	Fixes XCF loading/saving.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added "const gchar *stroke_desc" to
	the GimpItemClass struct and always push an undo group
	around GimpItem::stroke().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c: set the stroke_desc accordingly
	and don't push undo groups.

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_class_init): set
	all of GimpItemClass' undo_descs.

	* app/text/gimptextlayer-transform.c: don't push undo groups here.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpcolor/gimpcolorspace.c (gimp_rgb_to_hsv): applied patch
	from Marco Munari that removes a redundant "if" (bug #133540).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: applied patch from Yeti that
	adds spinbuttons instead of simple text entries (bug #138132).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/Makefile.am
	* plug-ins/common/plugin-defs.pl
	* plug-ins/common/gicon.c: removed the GIcon plug-in (addresses
	one aspect of bug #139160).

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Context cleanup continued:

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added context parameter to
	GimpItem::stroke().

	* app/core/gimpchannel.c (gimp_channel_stroke)
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c (gimp_vectors_stroke): use it to get
	default values from instead of gimp_get_user_context().

	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/gui/stroke-dialog.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/edit.pdb
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/paths.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c

	struct. Added context parameter to plug_in_new(),
	plug_in_call_query() and plug_in_call_init().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-run.[ch]: added context parameters to
	plug_in_run() and plug_in_repeat().

	* app/gui/plug-in-commands.c
	* app/gui/vectors-commands.c
	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c
	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: pass a context to plug_in_run() and
	plug_in_repeat().

	* app/plug-in/plug-in-message.c (plug_in_handle_proc_run): call
	procedures with the plug-in's context.

	* app/plug-in/plug-ins.c: use a temporary context for running the
	plug-ins' query() and init() functions. Use the same context for
	running automatic extensions. This temporarily separates the main
	Script-Fu extension from the user context (i.e. scripts have no
	way of setting/getting the global FG, BG, brush etc.).

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* NEWS
	* README: mention that this is the development branch.

2004-04-15  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs.[ch]:
	* app/paint-funcs/paint-funcs-generic.h: header cleanup, added
	some const qualifiers, converted tabs to spaces. Fixes bug #140115
	for the HEAD branch.

2004-04-15  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Get rid of the "current_context" which was in fact just a bunch of
	global variables. Instead, pass the needed context all the way
	from the GUI and the PDB to the core. This is a prerequisite for
	macro recording and generally helps separating the various
	subsystems from each other. Work in progress...

	* app/core/gimp.[ch]: removed member "current_context" and
	gimp_[get|set]_current_context().

	* app/core/gimp-edit.[ch]

	* app/pdb/*_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-04-14  RaphaÃ«l Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: New version of the
	script that works on a temporary copy of the image instead of
	copying the visible layers.  Fixes bug #139989.

2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/film.c: fixed typo (bug #140039).

2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: bumped version to 2.1.0, interface age 0, binary
	age 0. Changed library versioning to include gimp_minor_version
	similar to how gtk+ does it.

2004-04-14  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.0.1 release.

2004-04-13  RaphaÃ«l Quinet  <quinet@gamers.org>

	* plug-ins/common/mng.c (query, run): Workaround for bug #139947:
	do not register the plug-in for INDEXED* modes and do not declare
	that it can handle INDEXED images in gimp_export_image().  This
	forces a conversion to RGB instead of generating broken indexed
	images.  The generation of correct indexed MNG files is likely to
	require a newer release of libmng.
	(mng_data): Set default compression level to 9 instead of 6.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_cern_parse.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_csim_parse.c
	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_ncsa_parse.c: regenerated using GNU Bison
	version 1.875a. Fixes bug #139894.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c: reverted last change and go back to the
	solution using fork(). Hopefully fixes bug #139158 this time.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-utils.[ch] (gimp_get_default_language): added a
	category parameter to make this function more flexible.

	* app/text/gimptext.c: changed accordingly.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c (gimp_help): localize the help pages
	according to the value of LC_MESSAGES. Fixes bug #139917.

2004-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	Moved the calls to floating_sel_relax()/rigor() from various
	places to two single spots in the core where they are actually
	needed. Fixes bug #138356 (which was caused by the projection
	being triggered in the middle of changing the floating selection's
	size or the size of the drawable it is attached to). This commit
	effectively removes floating selection fiddling from the core's
	public API.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch] (gimp_drawable_has_floating_sel): new
	function which returns TRUE if there is a floating selection
	attached to the drawable.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_translate)
	(gimp_drawable_set_tiles_full): if the drawable *has* a floating
	selection, relax/rigor it before/after modifying the drawable.

	* app/core/gimplayer.c (gimp_layer_translate)
	(gimp_layer_set_tiles): if the layer *is* the floating selection,
	relax/rigor it before/after modifying it.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-convert.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-flip.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-resize.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-rotate.c
	* app/core/gimpimage-scale.c
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c
	* app/tools/gimpeditselectiontool.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: removed calls to
	floating_sel_rigor()/relax() all over the place. Also removed
	lots of undo groups which are obsolete now.

	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-04-13  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/imagemap/imap_file.c (do_file_error_dialog): convert
	the filename to UTF-8 before displaying it.

2004-04-13  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	GimpItem undo group cleanup in preparation of fixing bug #138356:

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch]: renamed LAYER_SCALE and LAYER_RESIZE
	undo groups to ITEM_SCALE and ITEM_RESIZE.

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: always push undo groups around
	GimpItem::translate(), scale(), resize(), flip(), rotate() and
	transform(). Added the resp. undo_desc strings to GimpItemClass.

	* app/core/gimpchannel.[ch]
	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]
	* app/core/gimplayer.c: removed all undo groups from
	implementations of the above methods. Removed the undo_desc
	strings which were moved to GimpItemClass.

	* app/core/gimpimage-crop.c
	* app/core/gimpselection.c
	* app/gui/layers-commands.c
	* app/vectors/gimpvectors.c
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/layer.pdb: changed accordingly.

	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-04-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: cleaned up the check for Xmu. Include <gdk/gdkx.h>
	when testing for Xmu.h. Fixes bug #139803.

2004-04-12  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* libgimpmath/Makefile.am: remove test-md5 on make clean.

2004-04-11  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/pygimp/plug-ins/py-slice.py: When using a separate dir for
	images, actually prepend the dir to the img srcs in the html. Allow
	only horizontal or vertical guides in an image, do not require both.
	A bit smarter path handling. Addresses most of bug #138714.

2004-04-11  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>

	* app/makefile.msc : build sanity.obj
	  app/text/makefile.msc : gimptextundo.obj
	  app/widgets/makefile.msc : gimppatternfactoryview.obj

	* plug-ins/common/winclipboard.c : don't call
	gimp_image_undo_enable() when it's not switched off.
	Otherwise the undo history would be destroyed with
	Gimp-Core-CRITICAL **: file gimpimage.c: line 1579: assertion
	`gimage->undo_freeze_count > 0' failed

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_apply): push an undo
	group only when it's needed. This resurrects text undo compression
	that broke when bug #137767 got fixed.

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* docs/gimp-remote.1.in: updated example URL.

2004-04-10  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): Applied patch from William
	Skaggs that addresses bug #120490.

	* app/sanity.c (sanity_check): Modified the message that reports
	an old version of Fontconfig in an attempt to make it more
	informative.

2004-04-10  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c (start_new_gimp): reverted the last change
	and did a different fix that involves closing the X display before
	starting gimp (bug #139158).

2004-04-09  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Uglier workaround for bug #138357, since
	the previous one did break error handling. Fixes bug #139571.

2004-04-09  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* README.i18n: s/14/20/ plus whitespace clean-up.

2004-04-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/siod-wrapper.c: applied a patch from Kevin
	Cozens that makes the Script-Fu PDB marshaller handle NULL
	strings. Some minor code cleanup. Fixes bug #139386.

2004-04-08  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/gimp-remote.c (start_new_gimp): applied a patch from
	Michael Matz that calls fork() before starting gimp. This is to
	avoid X server authentification problems (bug #139158).

2004-04-07  Henrik Brix Andersen  <brix@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): revert addition of "is" until all
	.po files are there.

2004-04-07  SamÃºel JÃ³n Gunnarsson  <sammi@techattack.nu>

	* configure.in: Added "is" to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-04-06  IÃ±aki LarraÃ±aga  <dooteo@euskalgnu.org>

	* configure.in: Added "eu" (Basque) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-04-05  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/copy-visible.scm: Use
	gimp-image-get-active-layer/channel instead of the passed
	drawable for later restoring the initially active layer/channel.
	Addresses bug #138662.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/drop-shadow.scm: Add a call to
	gimp-image-set-active-layer in order for it to fail early instead
	of failing with the undo group open in case the drawable is not
	suitable for applying the effect.

2004-04-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage.c (gimp_image_real_mode_changed): update the
	whole image.

	* app/display/gimpdisplay-handlers.c: removed obsolete
	"mode_changed" and "colormap_changed" handlers because GimpImage's
	default handlers already update the whole image.

2004-04-05  Pedro Gimeno  <pggimeno@wanadoo.es>

	Sanitize rectangle and ellipse selection handling (bug #138237
	and bug #138103):

	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.h
	* app/tools/gimprectselecttool.c (GimpRectSelectTool): new
	member "moved" indicating whether the cursor was moved after
	the click.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_coords_to_integer): New function for
	consistent conversion of the rectangle FP coords to pixels.
	(gimp_rect_select_tool_button_press,
	gimp_rect_select_tool_button_release,
	gimp_rect_select_tool_motion, gimp_rect_select_tool_draw): use
	it instead of fiddling with the FP coordinates. Update "moved"
	and use it to detect whether the selection needs to be cleared.

	* app/tools/gimpellipseselecttool.c
	(gimp_ellipse_select_tool_draw): use the new coords_to_integer
	function.

2004-04-05  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_ui.c: applied the second patch
	attached to bug #138788 by William Skaggs. Removes some user
	interface elements that have no corresponding implementation and
	fixes preview updates.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* NEWS.pre-2-0: moved old NEWS to this new file.

	* NEWS: list bugs fixed since 2.0.0.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* docs/Makefile.am: don't install gimptool symlinks to
	gimptool-2.0 and its manpage. gimp.m4 as installed with gimp-1.2
	looks for gimptool (bug #139024).

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-callbacks.c
	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.[ch] pass the bounding box of
	the exposed area to gimp_display_shell_draw_grid() and draw only
	the relevant part of the grid. Fixes bug #138081.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	Cache the GC for drawing the grid as suggested in bug #138081:

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell.[ch]: added a grid_gc member to
	GimpDisplayShell.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-handlers.c
	(gimp_display_shell_grid_notify_handler)
	(gimp_display_shell_disconnect): invalidate the grid GC.

	* app/display/gimpdisplayshell-draw.c (gimp_display_shell_draw_grid):
	use the cached grid_gc. Also applied the fix that Pedro Gimeno did
	for bug #138606.

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpundo.c (gimp_undo_type_to_name): added a missing
	call to gettext(). Fixes bug #139000.

2004-04-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gimptool-2.0.in: Create any directories in the install path that do
	not already exist. Fixes bug #138980.

	* docs/gimptool.1.in: s/dont/don't/g

2004-04-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimagemap.c (gimp_image_map_apply): do nothing if the
	selection is empty. Fixes bug #138973.

2004-04-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_new): create the
	initial text layer with a size of 1 x 1 since tile_manager_new()
	does not any longer accept 0 x 0.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.c (gimp_drawable_configure): check that
	width and height are > 0.

2004-04-03  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_main.c
	* plug-ins/Lighting/lighting_shade.c: applied the first of two
	patches attached to bug #138788 by William Skaggs.

2004-04-02  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/whirlpinch.c: set a proper pixelfetcher
	edge mode for bigger radii. Avoids getting garbage at the
	image borders.

2004-04-02  Dave Neary  <bolsh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c: Added .jpe to the list of extensions
	that the jpeg plug-in recognises. Fixes bug #138776.

2004-04-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/gui/user-install-dialog.c: unset the bg_pixmap and tweak
	style colors for all states. Sort of ugly but makes the dialog
	work better with more obscure themes (bug #138379).

2004-04-01  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* tools/kernelgen.c: updated a comment.

2004-04-01  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added undo type
	GIMP_UNDO_TEXT_LAYER_MODIFIED and undo group types
	GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_DRAWABLE and GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_DRAWABLE_MOD.

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.[ch]: added new new function
	gimp_image_undo_push_text_layer_modified() which makes
	modifications of the text_layer's "modified" boolean undoable.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable.[ch]: added new virtual function
	GimpDrawable::push_undo() and moved the actual undo pushing into
	the default implementation gimp_drawable_real_push_undo().

	* app/text/gimptextlayer.c (gimp_text_layer_push_undo): new
	function. Pushes the text_layer's modified state to the undo stack
	after upchaining and sets modified to TRUE.

	(gimp_text_layer_set_tiles): ditto.

	(gimp_lext_layer_apply_region)
	(gimp_text_layer_replace_region): removed because their default
	implementations already call gimp_drawable_push_undo().

	(gimp_text_layer_swap_pixels): removed because swap_pixels() is
	used by undo only and doesn't need to care about the text_layer's
	modified state.

	(gimp_text_layer_render): don't set modified to FALSE here because
	we can't push an undo step here.

	(gimp_text_layer_set): push the modified state to the undo stack
	and set it to FALSE here. Also push the layer's tiles if the
	layer was modified.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_apply): push "modified"
	to the undo stack and set it to FALSE here, too.

	Fixes bug #137767.

2004-03-31  Simon Budig  <simon@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimptransformtool.c: One really should use braces
	when mixing additions and multiplication and the operator
	precedence is not the desired one...

	I feel stupid...  :-)

2004-03-31  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimp-transform-utils.c
	(gimp_transform_matrix_perspective): make sure 0.0/0.0 results
	in 1.0, not NaN.

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): instead of returning NULL
	if the transformation shrinks the tiles completely away, return at
	least the pixel (or the row or column of pixels) which best covers
	the sub-pixel area of the transform result:

	- Changed rounding of the transformed coordinates from RINT()
	  to floor()/ceil() so we don't cut off sub-pixel portions of the
	  transform result.
	- Force the minimal size if the changed rounding didn't help.

	Fixes bug #138117.

	Also added paranoia code which falls back to clip_result if the
	passed matrix produces NaN coordinates (copied the FINITE() macro
	from image_cmds.c).

2004-03-30  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/grid-system.scm: define "map" here,
	the script used to take the definition from alien-glow-arrow.scm
	or beveled-pattern-arrow.scm. Also added an undo group around all
	operations. Fixes bug #138524.

2004-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/Makefile.am
	* app/sanity.[ch]: new files implementing sanity_check() for
	run-time checking library versions. Added a check for FreeType but
	disabled it until we figured if and how freetype causes some of
	the DLL hell bugs.

	* app/main.c (main): call it and abort if it fails.

	* app/app_procs.[ch]: added app_gui_abort() so main.c doesn't
	need to #include "gui/gui.h"

	* app/gui/gui.[ch] (gui_libs_init): removed library sanity checking.

	(gui_abort): new function which shows the abort message.

2004-03-30  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): revert addition of "pa" until
	all .po files are there.

2004-03-20  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "pa" for Punjabi to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-29  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/jpeg.c (struct my_error_mgr): Move setjump_buffer
	to the beginning of the structure, to make sure it is aligned on a
	16-byte boundary for ia64, even with icc. Fixes #138357.

2004-03-29  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/config/gimpguiconfig.c: changed the default for "help-locales"
	from NULL to an empty string. Fixes the generated gimprc man-page.

	* app/config/gimprc-blurbs.h (HELP_LOCALES_BLURB): added missing
	whitespace.

	* app/widgets/gimphelp.c: use the user's locale if "help-locales"
	is NULL or the empty string.

	* docs/gimprc.5.in
	* etc/gimprc: regenerated.

2004-03-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/core-enums.[ch] (enum GimpUndoType): added new group
	GIMP_UNDO_GROUP_FS_REMOVE.

	* app/core/gimplayer-floating-sel.c (floating_sel_remove): push an
	undo group. Fixes undo corruption spotted by Pedro Gimeno.

2004-03-29  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c (guillotine): Don't just skip
	guides at the image edges but any guide which is at a position we
	already remembered. Should catch all instances of bug #138312 this
	time.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/ifscompose/ifscompose.c: applied patch from David Necas
	that updates the sensitivity of the Delete button and menu entry.
	Fixes bug #138212.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/MapObject/mapobject_main.c: fixed non-interactive call.

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/spinning-globe.scm: pass -1 as
	drawable ID for unused drawables. Fixes bug #138253.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* app/text/gimpfontlist.c (gimp_font_list_add_font): validate the
	font name. This should work around the crashes that Windows users
	were experiencing on startup (bug #132366). The real problem needs
	to be fixed elsewhere though.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer): when re-adding
	a layer with mask, don't forget to set layer->mask->removed to FALSE.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpitem.[ch]: added "gboolean removed" to the GimpItem
	struct. Defaults to FALSE. Set it to TRUE in gimp_item_removed().
	Added public function gimp_item_is_removed().

	* app/core/gimpimage-undo-push.c (undo_pop_layer)
	(undo_pop_layer_mask) (undo_pop_channel) (undo_pop_vectors):
	set it to FALSE manually when re-adding something from the
	undo stack.

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl
	* tools/pdbgen/pdb.pl: don't allow any operation on items which
	are removed from the image (and exist on the undo stack only).
	Fixes bug #138311.

	* app/pdb/channel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/color_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/drawable_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/edit_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/floating_sel_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/image_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/layer_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/paint_tools_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/parasite_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/selection_tools_cmds.c
	* app/pdb/transform_tools_cmds.c: regenerated.

2004-03-28  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/script-fu/scripts/slide.scm: applied a (modified) patch
	from Nils Philippsen that fixes bug #138310.

2004-03-28  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* plug-ins/common/guillotine.c (guillotine): applied a (modified)
	patch from Joao S. O. Bueno which removes any guides from the
	cropped images. Fixes bug #138314.

	Skip guides which are at the image's edges because the algorithm
	already assumes that there are always guides at these positions.
	Fixes bug #138312.

2004-03-27  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@iki.fi>

	* plug-ins/help/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): Use -mwindows on Windows
	to avoid a console window popping up.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: don't generate code with tabs.

	* tools/pdbgen/pdb/procedural_db.pdb: convert tabs to spaces in
	helper function declaration.

	* app/pdb/procedural_db.c: convert tabs to spaces.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only tabs->spaces.

2004-03-26  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* tools/pdbgen/app.pl: kill whitespace in blank lines.

	* app/pdb/*.c: regenerated, no code changes, only whitespace.

2004-03-26  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/core/gimpdrawable-transform.c
	(gimp_drawable_transform_tiles_affine): return NULL tiles if the
	matrix would transform the drawable into nothing. Fixes the
	core-crashing part of bug #138117 and makes the script fail
	with an execution error.

2004-03-25  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* README: mention the gimp-perl pre-release and provide a link.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/base/tile-manager.c (tile_manager_new): g_return_if_fail()
	on width, height or bpp <= 0. Doesn't fix anything but badly
	warns (and helps debugging) on bug #138117.

2004-03-25  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* app/tools/gimpvectortool.c (gimp_vector_tool_button_release):
	fixed condition which triggers the path tool's undo hack.  Fixes
	bug #138086. Also g_object_unref() the undo step.

	Removed trailing whitespace.

2004-03-25  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* libgimp/gimp.c
	* app/plug-in/plug-in-shm.c: close the shm_open fd in the POSIX
	shm case. We were leaking an fd here.

	* app/tools/gimptexttool.c (gimp_text_tool_connect): remove
	unnecessary G_OBJECT() cast in g_object_set() call.

2004-03-23  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* autogen.sh: be verbose about AUTOGEN_CONFIGURE_ARGS in the
	message that is printed if no arguments were passed.

2004-03-23  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>
	    Michael Natterer <mitch@gimp.org>

	* Made 2.0.0 release.
